      "Abstract": "A major psychological problem that numerous new mothers experience is postpartum depression (PPD). A woman's capacity to care for herself and her child may be hampered by the sadness, anxiety, and weariness it can bring on. Using information from their past medical treatment, lifestyles, and habits, deep learning can assist in identifying women who are at risk for PPD. By analyzing large amounts of data from various sources, deep learning models can help healthcare providers provide targeted support and interventions to women most likely to develop PPD. This can improve outcomes for both mothers and babies and help to reduce the overall burden of PPD on families and society. To identify and validate risk variables for PPD disease in women at an early stage, this investigation provides a CNN-BLSTM with a TL-based model. The hybrid model combines transfer learning (TL) with bi-directional long short-term memory (BLSTM) models and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models. This model takes input data such as medical history, demographic information, and behavioural patterns and outputs the probability of the patient having PPD. The CNN component of the model mainly extracts the relevant features from the input data, while the LSTM component helps to analyze the sequential patterns in the data. By combining the strengths of both CNN and BLSTM, the model can effectively capture complex relationships within the input data and make accurate predictions. In the proposed model, we used it for transfer learning after Fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN + BLSTM model on a large dataset of non-PPD data to extract features. TL method helps to enhance the accuracy. We utilize an online PPD dataset which contains 1503 records of various women. The proposed model and well-known ML methods, i.e., Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost, were compared using various performance measuring parameters, i.e., Precision, Recall, F1-score, accuracy, and ROC_AUC. The proposed hybrid model achieved 99.6% accuracy and 99.7% precision which is higher than other methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Regenerative medicine and tissue engineering have emerged as a multidisciplinary promising field in the quest to address the limitations of traditional medical approaches. One of the key aspects of these fields is the development of such types of biomaterials that can mimic the extracellular matrix and provide a conducive environment for tissue regeneration. In this regard, chitosan has played a vital role which is a naturally derived linear bi-poly-aminosaccharide, and has gained significant attention due to its biocompatibility and unique properties. Chitosan possesses many unique physicochemical properties, making it a significant polysaccharide for different applications such as agriculture, nutraceutical, biomedical, food, nutraceutical, packaging, etc. as well as significant material for developing next-generation hydrogel and bio-scaffolds for regenerative medicinal applications. Moreover, chitosan can be easily modified to incorporate desirable properties, such as improved mechanical strength, enhanced biodegradability, and controlled release of bioactive molecules. Blending chitosan with other polymers or incorporating nanoparticles into its matrix further expands its potential in tissue engineering applications. This review summarizes the most recent studies of the last 10 years based on chitosan, blends, and nanocomposites and their application in bone tissue engineering, hard tissue engineering, dental implants, dental tissue engineering, dental fillers, and cartilage tissue engineering. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

      "Abstract": "The major sustainability concern is food waste, which might be minimized by more effective redistribution of surplus food, supply chain waste management, and sustainable food management. Due to technological and infrastructure issues that require technology application at a wide scale with minimal environmental impact, food waste and food loss occur at all levels of the supply chain. Strategies for food redistribution, recovery, and reuse provide the economy with extra by-products and financial advantages. Because of the complicated relationships between distributors and suppliers, contractual obligations, inaccurate food demand forecasts, and food standards, changing consumption and production patterns at the industry and market levels is difficult. Based on this the objective of the review was to discuss the strategies for reducing food waste and achieving sustainable development goals and the role of different actors in reducing food wastage and in implementing SDGs. Several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including those related to finishing world hunger (SDG 2), ensuring sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), promoting sustainable economic growth (SDG 8), and combating climate change (SDG 13), among others, have been found to depend on reducing the amount of food that is wasted and have destroyed. © 2024",

      "Abstract": "Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have risen as potential contenders for applications in supercapacitors (SCs) owing to their tunable porosity and surface chemistry. In this article, we synthesized Co-MOFs electrodes via Reaction Diffusion Framework approach, employing different linker concentrations, namely 0.7 M (CMA), 0.8 M (CMB), 0.9 M (CMC), and 1 M (CMD). The primary focus of this article lies in fine-tuning the concentration of the linker to optimize the synthesis of Co-MOFs, along with investigating how this optimization enhances their performance in an electrochemical study. Structural, morphological, and compositional studies have been conducted on Co-MOFs electrodes. Morphological studies unveiled CMB electrode exhibited a high interconnected leaf-like structure which enables high structural stability, low resistance, quick ion diffusion, and efficient charge-transfer in SCs than other electrodes. While the X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis confirmed that the Co 2p exhibited an oxidation state of + 2. The electrochemical results demonstrated a direct correlation between linker concentration and the resultant leaf-like architecture. Specifically, the CMB exhibited high SCs performance, including a specific capacity (Csp) of 66 mAh/g and a specific capacitance (Cs) of 597 F/g at 5 mV/s, maintaining an impressive cyclic stability of 80 % over 3000th cycles at 100 mV/s. Additionally, it achieved a good energy density (Ed) of 11.14 Wh/kg and power density (Pd) of 4000 W/kg at 4 mA/cm². Furthermore, the solid-state device was fabricated and evaluated for its practical application in SCs. This device achieved higher Cs of 49 F/g at 10 mV/s, along with an 82 % retention rate over 2000 cycles at 15 mA. Moreover, this device attained a good Ed of 3.56 Wh/kg and Pd of 2266 W/kg at 4 mA.

      "Abstract": "The aims of this study were isolation-purification and characterization of l-glutaminase from L. gasseri BRLHM clinical isolates and investigation of its efficiency as an antimicrobial agent against multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. The MICs of l-glutaminase and gentamicin reference were evaluated by the well-diffusion method. The biofilm on the IUD contraceptive was visualized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) image analyses. The purified l-glutaminase possessed significant antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa isolates (p < 0.05), and the antibiofilm formation activity of the purified l-glutaminase was stronger than the antibiofilm activity of the referral standard drug, gentamicin (P < 0.05), which were checked by the inhibition of the biofilm formation on the IUD contraceptive device. Investigations indicated that l-glutaminase may have a crucial role in future clinical applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the Japan Antibiotics Research Association.",

      "Abstract": "Complex Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) security assaults threaten the expansion of intelligent network infrastructure for the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT cannot be protected by the enterprise network security solutions currently in use because they are too expensive. Integrating newly developed software-defined networking (SDN) technology effectively mitigates a computational load on an IoT network device, enabling the implementation of supplementary security measures. Because it is utilized in the precursor stage of the design for SDN-enabled IoT networks. However, sampling-based security offers poor DDoS attack detection accuracy. This study aims to investigate cognitive techniques for detecting and mitigating cyber risks in software-defined and contemporary network applications. SDN is a modern technology network that allows for centralized control and cyber threat detection with built-in machine learning techniques for increasing the adoption of (IoT) devices. SDN applications have become vulnerable to cyber threats. To ensure the security of these applications, detection and mitigation of cyber threats are crucial. Adopting SDN can result in benefits, including increased manageability, scalability, and overall performance. However, SDN poses issues, primarily if it is controlled and open to DDoS attacks. Machine learning-based models were employed in this specific research project to identify DDoS attacks in SDN. Based on the research results, the KNN classifier, in combination with the wrapper feature, leads to the most fantastic accuracy rate of about 98.3% in detecting attacks. The results of this study indicate that in addition to the anticipated reduction in processing burdens, feature selection and machine learnin g techniques can enhance DDoS attack detection in SDN. © 2024, Ismail Saritas.

      "Abstract": "Traditional agriculture relies heavily on chemical inputs, which pose significant threats to the environment and deplete natural resources. The environmental challenges posed by chemical-based agriculture and emphasizes the urgent need for sustainable alternatives in the face of climate change. Acknowledging the detrimental impact of environmental stressors on global agriculture sets the stage for exploration of PGPR as a promising solution. Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) have emerged as a sustainable alternative, fostering plant development, and enhancing stress resilience. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying signalling pathways and stress management mechanisms is essential to maximizing their potential. Plant health has been demonstrated, nutrient uptake has improved, and environmental stress has been reduced with the help of PGPR. Identifying the specific plant signalling pathways that are impacted by PGPR and comprehending their function in stress mitigation are critical to creating efficient and sustainable farming practises. Utilizing PGPR-mediated stress control may reduce the need for chemical inputs, encouraging environmentally friendly farming methods. By creating genetically engineered crops with increased stress tolerance, the knowledge gathered in this review can help ensure food security in the face of climate change. The signalling pathways involved, the processes underpinning PGPR-plant interactions, and the responses of plants to diverse stressors when PGPR is present have been explored. This review offers helpful insights into the intricate link between PGPR and plants, putting light on the uncertainties that beg for additional research by critically analysing the present literature and highlighting knowledge gaps. © 2024 The Authors",

      "Abstract": "A large amount of stabilized municipal solid waste (SMSW) obtained in landfill mining operations constitutes about 60–70% of total mining waste. In this study, attempts were made to use SMSW in paver block construction, a unique solution for unpaved urban surfaces considering its ease of handling and low cost. The mechanical and durability properties of the paver block, along with microstructure and mineralogical analysis, were investigated in which various dosages of SMSW vary from 10–50% by the weight of natural sand. The results of various tests, i.e., compressive, flexural strength, abrasion resistance, water absorption, and analysis of microstructure and mineralogical, revealed that SMSW as a partial replacement of natural sand up to 30% replacement could be satisfactorily used in the paver block construction, especially in the low volume roads. Also, the replacements, 40% and 50%, can be used for footpaths, cycle paths, garden parks, domestic drives, and embankment slopes. The geometrical properties and visual aspects were checked to confirm the production standardization of the paver blocks. All the samples have shown promising results in respect of all dimensions. The statistical analysis exhibited that the SMSW had a significant effect on the compressive and flexural strength of the paver block. Therefore, incorporating SMSW as a natural sand replacement will be a sustainable and economical construction solution for light-traffic roads. It also promotes a ‘Circular economy’ as it recycles the stabilized municipal solid waste. © 2023 The Institution of Chemical Engineers",

      "Abstract": "In the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, off-grid hybrid systems have emerged as a promising avenue, catering to the electrification needs of rural areas. These systems encompass a multifaceted approach, addressing concerns of reliability, sustainability, and environmental preservation. Leveraging advanced tools such as HOMER modeling, the design and simulation of hybrid off-grid systems, alongside the evaluation of existing diesel generator (DG) power supply, have become imperative. This paper embarks on a comprehensive exploration with the overarching objective of designing, modeling, and simulating an off-grid power system tailored for the Shinshicho Primary Hospital. Nestled in the heart of Shinshicho Town within the Kembata Tembaro Zone of Ethiopia, this healthcare facility stands as a focal point for community well-being. The proposed hybrid system integrates solar PV, diesel generators, and battery storage, offering a robust and resilient energy solution. Throughout the optimization process, a primary load demand of 276 kgwatt-hours per day and a peak load of 40 kW were pivotal considerations. The financial cost of this hybrid system results in an initial capital requirement of $160,500, complemented by operational and maintenance costs amounting to $14,824. Over the projected 20-year lifespan, the total net present cost (NPC) is estimated at $216,155. With these economic parameters in mind, the cost-effectiveness of the selected hybrid system is underscored by a cost of energy (CEO) of 0.187 dollars per kilowatt-hour. This metric not only highlights the economic viability of the proposed solution but also positions it as a sustainable and financially prudent choice for meeting the energy needs of Shinshicho Primary Hospital. © 2024 The Author(s)",

      "Abstract": "This paper summarizes the approach to identify the most concerning environmental issues E-commerce companies have. When doing so, a comprehensive framework for considering the complex interplays, such as transport vehicles and emissions generated, single use plastics ban, sustainable packaging alternatives that must be addressed, and to drive requirements for climate change and plastic pollution, was provided. Finally, an attempt has been made to explore any correlation that might exist between environmental and social sustainability with the hiring and retention of employees. In addition to the financial benefits that sustainability practice provides, environmentally friendly business measures, such as energy conservation, recycling, and energy-efficient equipment and reducing waste, have proven to be more efficient and cost-effective than traditional methods, and it was also found that employee retention, productivity, and overall engagement all escalate. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",

      "Abstract": "The system of glucose-insulin control and associated problems in diabetes mellitus were studied by mathematical modeling. It is a helpful theoretical tool for understanding the basic concepts of numerous distinct medical and biological functions. It delves into the various risk factors contributing to the onset of diabetes, such as sedentary lifestyle, obesity, family history, viruses, and increasing age. The study emphasizes the importance of mathematical models in understanding the dynamic characteristics of biological systems. The study emphasizes the increasing prevalence of diabetes, especially in India, where urbanization and lifestyle changes contribute to the rising incidence. The present investigation describes the use of John Holland's evolutionary computing approach and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) in diabetes mellitus. The Genetic Algorithm is applied to address issues related to diabetes, offering a generic solution and utilizing MATLAB's Genetic Algorithm tool. The Mathematical Model provides differential equations representing glucose and insulin concentrations in the blood. The results represent testing outcomes for normal, prediabetic, and diabetic individuals, optimized with Genetic Algorithm showcased through fitness value plots. The conclusion highlights the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithm as an optimization tool in predicting optimal samples for diabetes diagnosis. The paper encourages the use of heuristic algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithms, to address complex challenges in the field of diabetes research. Future scope includes further exploration of biomathematics and Genetic Algorithm applications for enhanced understanding and management of diabetes mellitus. It is critical for people with diabetes to consistently check their blood glucose levels and follow their treatment plan. © 2024 International Academic Publishing House (IAPH). All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the essential staple foods highly consumed globally, with nearly 40% to 45% of the global population estimated to consume rice. Therefore, consumable rice should have low levels of harmful elements. This study investigates fluoride (F¯) content in raw rice (uncooked rice) and evaluates Probabilistic Health Risk Assessment (PHRA) through Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) due to the consumption of F¯ enriched rice. The literature review reveals that limited studies have been conducted on the investigation of F¯ in raw rice. The fluoride (F¯) concentration in raw rice varies across the studied countries, indicating the need for additional studies to facilitate a more accurate comparison. The F¯ content in raw rice varied among the studied countries, making it difficult to definitively state that the concentration of F¯ in one country is higher. However, the concentration of F¯ in raw rice in India is notably elevated. This study also highlighted the importance of investigating the F¯ content in raw rice. The study will be highly helpful for policymakers to formulate guidelines for water used for irrigation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",

      "Abstract": "In order to facilitate communication, wireless networks are built from a collection of nodes that may be either static or dynamic. They are acquiring a lot of popularity in the area of research due to the fact that they are ad hoc in nature, and the number of users of mobile devices is rising day by day. Because of the ease with which these networks may be deployed in challenging and unsupervised rural places, the exchange of information has been a reality since the invention of these networks. Mobile ad hoc networks are simple to set up because of the properties that allow for self-organization and the fact that the medium is wireless. A lack of centralized fixed infrastructure, flexibility to frequent change in topologies, and other features like these are some of the other things that draw people's attention to wireless networks. Wireless networks are vulnerable to a wide range of assaults since their nodes are able to move around and their topologies are constantly changing. In addition, MANET operates in an environment that is both open and dynamic, which leaves it subject to a variety of threats from other types of network assaults. Routing protocols are almost always the target of one form or another of the same general category of attacks. Eavesdropping, causing damage, changing routing information, deleting routing information, manipulating information, advertising phoney routes, and misrouting information are all potential components of these assaults. The circumstances may make it difficult to maintain confidentiality in any communications. There are many different kinds of assaults, and each one may damage wireless networks on a different tier of the communication stack and bring the performance of the network down. Eavesdropping, jamming, traffic analysis and monitoring, denial of service attacks, grey hole attacks, black hole attacks, and wormhole assaults are a few examples of the many sorts of attacks that fall under this category. Ad-hoc networks are more susceptible to security breaches than traditional wired and wireless networks due to the usage of open wireless medium, dynamic topology, and dispersed and cooperative channel sharing. The wormhole attack on dispersed wireless networks is being described here by the person who conducted this study. Because this assault is so potent, it is very difficult to identify it before it has ever been launched. The invader may simply initiate it without having knowledge of the network or compromising any authorized nodes, which is a need for launching it. During a wormhole attack, a malicious node in one part of the network takes control of the packets and tunnels them to another hostile node in a different part of the network, which then repeats the packets locally. The thesis aims to do two things at the same time: (a) To simulate a variety of possible wormhole assaults on the MANET network (b) To investigate the functionality and efficiency of the proposed secure routing protocol within the context of these simulated attacks on the network. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",

      "Abstract": "Hardness of wheat endosperm is a physical property that depends on the genetic makeup of the grain and varies amongst different types/varieties. It is associated with proteins, particularly 14–15 kDa friabilins, which exist in higher amounts at the surface of starch in soft wheat grains while either absent or occur in smaller quantities on granules of hard wheat varieties. The storage proteins in hard wheat flours exhibit a higher proportion of polymeric proteins, β-sheets and β-turns. Soft wheat starches show lower crystallinity, amylose-lipid complex content and proportion of A-type granules (disk or lenticular-shaped granules with diameter >10 µm) while higher gelatinisation temperatures, swelling, breakdown susceptibility and retrogradation than hard wheat starches. Flours from hard and soft wheat also differ for processing and end-use quality based on differences in dough rheological properties, solvent retention capacities and particle size. © 2024 The Author(s)",

      "Abstract": "Background: Root canal re-treatment (RCR) cases are considered some of the most challenging cases in the field of endodontics, as they are mostly associated with various iatrogenic errors such as ledge formation, incomplete biomechanical preparation, file separation, and incomplete obturation. These iatrogenic errors lead to defective niches within root canals that may act as reservoirs for various viable microorganisms. Such residual microbial niches may cause postoperative pain even after thorough debridement and reshaping the canals, ultimately leading to a poor prognosis for the tooth. Nowadays, prevention of postoperative pain in re-treatment cases and prognosis are effectively managed by photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT). Method: Relevant studies in the English language published before November 2022 were identified using electronic databases like PubMed, SCOPUS, and EBSCO to conduct bibliographic research. This systematic review is based on 3 studies that were found eligible as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This systematic review is in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Results: The systematic review indicated a positive impact by significantly decreasing postoperative pain in RCR cases when treated with PBMT. The variation was statistically significant at 24 hours (P = .0002), 48 hours (P = .03), and 72 hours (P = .02). The mean difference at 24 hours was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.32–0.99), at 48 hours was 0.46 (95% CI, 0.05–0.87), and at 72 hours was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.07–0.74). There was no statistical heterogenicity at 24 hours (P > .05), but a medium heterogenicity was observed at 48 hours and 72 hours. Practical implication: PBMT or low-level laser therapy has shown superior results as compared to the conventional pharmacologic approach in postoperative pain management in RCR cases. © 2023 The Authors",

      "Abstract": "Introduction Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome affects a significant proportion of our breast and ovarian cancer patients. Mutations in genes, for example, BRCA1 and 2, confer a high risk of acquiring certain malignancies, including breast cancer in both men and women, and ovarian cancer in women. Mutation carriers provide a unique opportunity for healthcare professionals to intensively screen and detect malignancy at an early and curable stage. But, patient awareness and acceptance are the keys to the success of these strategies. Objective There is a need to assess the awareness of the patients in this field as the patients come from varied backgrounds, and differ in their socioeconomic profiles, educational backdrop, and cultures. In this study, done prior to establishing our cancer genetics clinic, we evaluated the knowledge and attitude toward HBOC in patients with breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Materials and Methods This cross-sectional observational study was conducted on patients registered in IRCH-AIIMS, who has a diagnosis of breast cancer or ovarian cancer using a self-administered questionnaire based on knowledge and attitude. The sample population included 84 women aged between 25 and 80 years. A binary response was given to knowledge questions, whereas a categorical response was given to attitude questions. The overall data was computed using STATA v13 software. Results According to the findings of the study, 39.3% (5.11/13) of the patients were aware of hereditary cancer. Knowledge among the targeted population was poor, but 72.1% (37.5/52) of the population had a neutral attitude toward learning more about hereditary cancer tests. Only 23/84 (27%) people had heard of genetic counseling. Seventy of eighty-four (83%) patients agreed that they would opt for a genetic test if indicated. While 60/84 (72%) of the population wanted to interact with a counselor over a telephonic call, only 41/84 (49%) wanted to interact in person. Conclusion We concluded from the study that breast and ovarian cancer patients in our clinic have little understanding of HBOC syndrome but have a neutral attitude toward learning more about it. © 2024 Georg Thieme Verlag.

      "Abstract": "This abstract delves into the exploration of avenues for the assessment of biopolymers in eco-friendly materials, shedding light on their attributes, uses, and imminent obstacles. The evaluation of biopolymers entails a comprehensive scrutiny of their physical, mechanical, thermal, and barrier characteristics, along with their degradation behavior and compatibility with other materials. Techniques such as rheology, spectroscopy, microscopy, and thermal analysis assume crucial roles in the characterization of biopolymers and the determination of their suitability for diverse applications. Biopolymers discover applications in an extensive array of sectors, including packaging, textiles, automotive, electronics, and the biomedical industry. Their intrinsic biodegradability, biocompatibility, and low carbon footprint render them appealing for a multitude of uses. Furthermore, biopolymers can be tailored to exhibit specific properties, permitting customization to meet precise requirements. Notwithstanding their potential, several challenges impede the widespread acceptance of biopolymers. These challenges encompass the restricted availability of raw materials, elevated production costs, subpar mechanical properties when compared to traditional polymers, and the necessity for enhanced processing techniques. Additionally, the management of end-of-life biopolymer-based products and the disposal of biopolymer waste necessitate meticulous consideration to ensure the full realization of their environmental advantages. The resolution of these challenges mandates interdisciplinary cooperation among researchers, policymakers, industry stakeholders, and consumers. The development of innovative processing methodologies, efficient recycling technologies, and sustainable supply chains is indispensable to unlock the complete potential of biopolymers and guarantee their seamless integration into eco-friendly materials. The evaluation of biopolymers in sustainable materials involves a multifaceted strategy encompassing comprehensive characterization, customization for specific applications, and surmounting extant challenges. By advancing our comprehension of biopolymer attributes and refining their manufacturing and disposal procedures, we can chart a course towards a more environmentally friendly and sustainable future. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

      "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodegenerative illness that impacts individuals' social abilities. The majority of available approaches rely on structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect ASD with a small dataset, resulting in high accuracy but low generality. To detect ASD with a limited dataset, the bulk of known technologies involve Machine Learning, pattern recognition, and other techniques, leading to high accuracy but moderate generality. To address this constraint and improve the efficacy of the automated autism diagnosis model, an ASD detection model based on deep learning (DL) is provided in this work. The classification challenge is solved using a convolutional neural network classifier. The suggested model beats state-of-the-art methodologies in terms of accuracy, according to simulation findings. The proposed approach investigates how anatomical and functional connectivity indicators can be used to determine whether or not a person is autistic. The proposed method delivers state-of-the-art results, with the classification of Autistic patients achieving 93.41% accuracy and the localization of the classified data regressed to 0.29 mean absolute error (MAE). © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

      "Abstract": "As a sustainable mode of transportation, electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity, and their integration with the power grid and photovoltaic (PV) solar systems is essential for their widespread adoption. Solar PV and EV systems have improved based on the generation and demands of the power grid. However, incorporating EV chargers with the grid and PV solar systems can cause power quality issues and stability problems that can impact the charger's performance and affect the charging procedure. EV technologies are divided into two major components: electric propulsion systems and EV charging systems. The electric propulsion system delivers the necessary energy for the EV motor in an EV system. In addition, with higher penetration, EVs and PVs are anticipated to emerge as new participants in the energy market operation and can play a crucial role in redefining the market. Many have integrated into the electricity network to reach renewable energy sources (RES), such as wind and solar PV. The study concludes that continued research and development are necessary to upgrade the power quality and solidness of EV charging frameworks, to ensure the seamless integration of PV solar systems and electric vehicles into the grid, and to promote sustainable transportation. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",

      "Abstract": "A structure known as a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is formed when mobile nodes come together to communicate with each other, offering a broad spectrum of applications. MANET, characterized by its lack of a central monitoring authority and absence of a fixed infrastructure, gains popularity due to its ubiquitous nature. However, the openness of MANET introduces security challenges that require detection and resolution. One prevalent issue is the Packet Drop Attack, wherein an intruder falsely claims to possess the shortest route to the destination, dropping all packets without forwarding them. This paper addresses the mitigation of this problem, focusing on the optimal solution for the Blackhole Attack. Researchers employ various techniques, such as Opinion-based, Trust-based, Intrusion Detection, Crypto-based, and Destination Sequence Number (DSN) based methods. The proposed method specifically employs DSN, where the attacker lures packets by sending a forged RREP message to the source node. To thwart this, the DSN in the proposed method is compared to a threshold value, allowing the rejection of forged RREP messages. © 2024, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "This study investigates a novel methodology to intricately craft a HAMMC and thoroughly examine its multifaceted mechanical and tribological characteristics. By combining silicon carbide (SiC) and fly ash as reinforcements, a unique identity is bestowed upon this hybrid composite, enhancing its structural integrity and functional attributes. Stir casting is the chosen methodology for fabricating this composite, favored for its economic viability and suitability for large-scale manufacturing. In this research, the emphasis is on developing a cost-effective composite that not only meets stringent economic considerations but also exhibits improved material properties. Within the realm of hybrid metal matrix composites, the well-regarded Al6061 takes on the role of the matrix material, while the synergistic inclusion of fly ash and SiC serves as reinforcing constituents. Three specimens with compostion 90% Al6061 + 5% SiC +5% Fly ash, 90% Al6061 + 10% SiC +6% Fly ash and 90% Al6061 + 15% SiC +7% Fly ash were fabricated. To unravel the intricacies of the fabricated Al6061 metal matrix composite, comprehensive tests are employed. These tests, including the Pin-on Disc test, Scratch test, Rockwell Hardness test, and Charpy Impact test, collectively work to unveil the nuanced tribological and mechanical behaviors encapsulated within this innovative alloy. The results indicated significant improvement in wear resistance in specimen comprising 78% Al6061 + 15% SiC +7% Fly Ash and volumetric loss found to have 0.96 g. Superior hardness characteristics and enhanced abrasion resistance found in 78% Al6061 + 15% SiC +7% Fly Ash than other two specimens. The highest impact strength exhibited in 90% Al 6,061 + 5% SiC +5% Fly ash specimen. Copyright © 2024 Kumar Murmu, Chattopadhayaya, Cep, Kumar, Kumar, Kumar Mahato, Kumar, Ranjan Sethy and Logesh.",

      "Abstract": "Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is the most common knee injury among athle-tes, and can result in long-term complications and career-ending conditions for sportspeople. There is no consensus in the literature on the effectiveness of rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction, or the best protocol to follow for functional outcome improve-ment. Objective: To determine the impact of an accelerated rehabilitation protocol on knee functional outcomes in amateur athletes with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Design: Two-arm, parallel-group randomized compa-rative design. Patients: A total of 100 amateur male athletes (mean age 22.01 ± 1.79 years) with ACLR were randomly divided into experimental and control groups (n = 50/ group). Methods: An accelerated rehabilitation protocol and a conventional rehabilitation protocol were used for the experimental group. In contrast, only the conventional rehabilitation protocol was used for the control group. The rehabilitation was delivered in 5 weekly sessions for 22 weeks. The primary outcome measure, knee pain, was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Extensive test batteries, for hop tests, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and knee effusion, were measured, aiming to add more objective criteria to determine functional performance. Results: Both groups (n = 50/group) were well-matched (p = 0.816), with insignificant differences in their demographic characteristics (p > 0.05). A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test sho-wed no significant difference between the 2 groups (p = 0.781) at baseline. A 2-way MANOVA (2 × 2 MANOVA) of within-and between-group variations indicated overall significant treatment, time, and treatment × time interaction effects (p < 0.001) in favour of the accelerated rehabilitation group. Conclusion: The accelerated rehabilitation protocol was more effective in improving functional outcomes than a conventional rehabilitation protocol in amateur athletes with ACLR. © 2024, Medical Journals Sweden AB.

      "Abstract": "The objective of this study is to identify a metric suite for software fault prediction that can solve challenges related to reliability, quality, time, and cost of the software project. This research paper describes the design and analysis of the proposed metric suite (requirement-based metric and agile-based metric) to predict faults in software projects that is based on a formula using process metrics as inputs from a real-time, wider dataset from the PROMISE repository. The formula has been developed in Python. Pearson correlation analysis has been applied to determine the relationship between the proposed metric suite and the faults (dependent variable) of software projects. The correlation coefficients of requirement-based metrics and agile-based metrics with faults are 0.82165 and 0.731033, respectively, which implies that the proposed metric suite has a strong positive relationship with the faults. For empirical analysis, decision-tree regression of machine learning has been used to explore the validity of the proposed metric suite. The regression analysis outcomes based on the statistical performance evolution measures (AUC and F1-measure) of the requirement-based metric with predicted faults are 0.9871 and 0.9367, respectively, and of the agile-based metric with predicted faults are 1.0 and 0.67, respectively, revealing that the proposed metric suite can be applied as the best predictor for the prediction of faults. By comparing the prediction and validation results of the proposed metrics for the same dataset, it has been concluded that the requirement-based metric has the best performance with values of MMRE, RMSE, and NRMSE of 3.61e-05, 6.07779, and 0.0034748, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

      "Abstract": "The increasing concern on contamination and a perilous atmospheric deviation has provoked the Photovoltaic (PV) framework as one of the conceivable, inexhaustible and clean energy in power framework generation. Power quality problems like Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) have become an inexorably genuine problem as more Photovoltaic setups are coordinated into the grid framework. This urges a broad analysis to distinguish the challenges in power system organization. The proposed microgrid model consists of MPPT-Maximum Power Point Tracking system, a converter, and a multi-stage inverter. In this study, power active and passive filters are utilized; further cases are analyzed for power quality issues to reduce the harmonics using MATLAB simulation. © 2024, Ismail Saritas.

      "Abstract": "The increasing complexity of global food networks and the possible hazards of fraud, foodborne diseases, and environmental damage highlight the need for strong food traceability systems. Nanoscale carbonaceous materials known as ‘carbon dots’ (CDs), have attracted interest due to their special optical qualities, biocompatibility, and capacity for surface functionalization. Due to these characteristics, Carbon Dots are perfect candidates for the creation of nanosensors that can track and identify indications at every stage of the manufacturing and distribution of food. Innovative solutions are required since conventional systems frequently fail to provide comprehensive and real-time information throughout the food supply chain. There are many different uses for Carbon Dots-based nanosensors in food traceability applications. These nanosensors can be designed to track the origins of food items, detect viruses, identify counterfeit goods, and monitor storage conditions. They are a vital tool for guaranteeing the security, authenticity, and quality of the food supply because of their great sensitivity, selectivity, and quick reaction. The overall objective of sustainable development is in line with the ecologically friendly characteristics of Carbon Dots. Various types of Carbon Dots and their working mechanism has been described in this review. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

      "Abstract": "Heavy metals are extremely hazardous for human health due to their toxic effects. They are non-biodegradable in nature, thus remain in the environment and enter and accumulate in the human body through biomagnification; hence, there is a serious need of their remediation. Phytoremediation has emerged as a green, sustainable, and effective solution for heavy metal removal and many plant species could be employed for this purpose. Plants are able to sequester substantial quantity of heavy metals, in some cases thousands of ppm, due to their robust physiology enabling high metal tolerance and anatomy supporting metal ion accumulation. Identification and modification of potential target genes involved in heavy metal accumulation have led to improved phytoremediation capacity of plants at the molecular level. The introduction of foreign genes through genetic engineering approaches has further enhanced phytoremediation capacity manifolds. This review gives an insight towards improving the phytoremediation efficiency through a better understanding of molecular mechanisms involved, expression of different proteins, genetic engineering approaches for transgenic production, and genetic modifications. It also comprehends novel omics tools such as genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and genome editing technologies for improvement of phytoremediation ability of plants.

      "Abstract": "In plants, nitric oxide (NO) has become a versatile signaling molecule essential for mediating a wide range of physiological processes under various biotic and abiotic stress conditions. The fundamental function of NO under various stress scenarios has led to a paradigm shift in which NO is now seen as both a free radical liberated from the toxic product of oxidative metabolism and an agent that aids in plant sustenance. Numerous studies on NO biology have shown that NO is an important signal for germination, leaf senescence, photosynthesis, plant growth, pollen growth, and other processes. It is implicated in defense responses against pathogensas well as adaptation of plants in response to environmental cues like salinity, drought, and temperature extremes which demonstrates its multifaceted role. NO can carry out its biological action in a variety of ways, including interaction with protein kinases, modifying gene expression, and releasing secondary messengers. In addition to these signaling events, NO may also be in charge of the chromatin modifications, nitration, and S-nitrosylation-induced posttranslational modifications (PTM) of target proteins. Deciphering the molecular mechanism behind its essential function is essential to unravel the regulatory networks controlling the responses of plants to various environmental stimuli. Taking into consideration the versatile role of NO, an effort has been made to interpret its mode of action based on the post-translational modifications and to cover shreds of evidence for increased growth parameters along with an altered gene expression. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",

      "Abstract": "In 2019, an estimated one in eight people globally was living with a mental disorder. The (point) prevalence of mental disorders was around 13%. Pre-pandemic, an estimated 970 million people in the world were living with a mental disorder, 82% of whom were in low- and middle-income countries. The treatment gap for severe mental health conditions is a staggering 90% (World mental health report, 2022). Post-pandemic, just a year after the pandemic, depressive and anxiety disorders increased by 28% and 26%, respectively. To cover up for such a huge demand and supply gap, it is important to explore various ways of increasing access to mental health services especially in digital domain and make it accessible to masses. The objective of this study is to find ways of collaboration so that digital infrastructure can be utilized maximally for increasing the access to mental health services to everyone including those living remotely. With authors having huge experience of supervising usage of digital services in various verticals and collaborating in both public and private fields at various levels for the last many years, the article highlights the opportunities, challenges, and solutions highlighting the need for all stakeholders to come together for making digital mental health services accessible to the whole population. India and developing countries with their respective resources in public and private sector in the field of mental health must modify existing policies and enhance, upgrade, and utilize the existing digital infrastructure and services in such a way that their public-private partnership (PPP) model thrives in providing uninterrupted digital mental health services with scalable model to the masses by monitoring the operations, getting optimum outcomes, and keeping quality check with solid confidentiality and data privacy ecosystem for people thus increasing access and aiding in high-quality prevention and treatment of mental disorders. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Introduction: The present study evaluated the effect of 2 different back pressure-based supplemental anesthesia on postoperative pain in patients receiving endodontic treatment for a mandibular molar with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. Methods: One-hundred-thirty-five adult patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpits in a mandibular first or second molar, received an initial inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) injection with 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine. Ten minutes following the injection, access to cavity preparation began. Lip numbness was a must for all patients. The Heft-Parker visual analogue scale (HP-VAS) was used to measure pain during endodontic therapy. Success of primary injections was defined as no or mild pain (less than 55 mm on HP-VAS) during access preparation. The patients with initial successful anesthesia served as control and received endodontic treatment. Ninety-five patients with unsuccessful primary anesthesia randomly received either intraligamentary injections of 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine or intrapulpal injections with similar anesthetic solution. Endodontic treatment was re-initiated and canals were instrumented till working length under copious irrigation. Intracanal medicament of calcium hydroxide was placed and teeth received a temporary restoration. Postoperative pain was measured at 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours, and 3 days. Data were analyzed using the Pearson chi-square test, one-way analysis of variance, and one-way repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: The initial initial inferior alveolar nerve block was successful in 40 cases (out of 135). The intraligamentary injections were successful in 33 out of 47 cases (70%), and intrapulpal injections were successful in all cases (45/45). The patients receiving intraligamentary injections reported significantly higher pain scores at all intervals till 24 hours. After 3 days, the pain significantly reduced in all the groups with no significant difference between them. Conclusions: Patients receiving supplementary intraligamentary injections can experience increased postoperative pain till 24 hours after the endodontic treatment. The pain scores reduced to the level of the control group after 3 days. © 2024 American Association of Endodontists",

      "Abstract": "The concept of security is quite broad and touches the lives of one million people on a daily basis. Those individuals who depend on networks for activities such as banking, shopping, and filing their tax returns may soon face a potentially significant challenge in the form of network security, which will need to be handled in the not-too-distant future. The solution that is being recommended is a combination of two algorithms: The Hybrid Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) algorithm and the Ant Lion Optimization Algorithm. There have been two noteworthy developments in the requirements for information security inside a wireless sensor network over the course of the last several decades. First, prior to the broad use of data processing equipment, the security of information that was regarded useful to a wireless sensor network was largely supplied by physical and administrative precautions. This was the case even after the widespread use of data processing equipment. Hash functions are used by these designs whenever Rebalanced RSA is used to encrypt a message. This helps to guarantee that the integrity of the message is not compromised in any way. It has been found out that this novel method is susceptible to attacks based on selected ciphertext as well as adaptive attacks based on chosen ciphertext. A second strategy, which entails converting the ciphertext into binary format, is also one of the options that are being investigated. The binary format is further compressed and coded, which makes it resistant to a variety of attacks, including adaptive chosen ciphertext assaults, selected ciphertext assaults, and other assaults. To get started, a thorough study project on mapping is carried out in order to establish the mapping of assaults and counterattacks that would be most effective. A brand-new index that goes by the name \"Threat Severity Index\" (TSI) has been developed with the intention of determining how secure each individual system is on the whole. In addition, the decryption performance of RSA-type cryptosystems is researched and compared with that of other RSA-type cryptosystems in order to identify which cryptosystem provides the quickest decryption time. Last but not least, an overall rating of each system is provided, taking into account both its speed and its level of safety. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",

      "Abstract": "Agricultural solid waste (ASW) is a serious concern globally, specifically in agricultural countries like India, China, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc. A lot of agricultural waste like the remain of crop plants, peels, leaves, corn cob, decayed crops, etc., is produced directly or indirectly every year affecting the environment and is not appropriately managed. Therefore, to overcome this problem, there is a need to develop waste redemption techniques to transform solid waste into value-added products. The wastes are generally rich in carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and many other organic and inorganic constituents. This composition allows us to produce numerous value-added products like livestock feed, bio-preservatives, biofuels, biofertilizers, single-cell proteins, nanoparticles, biodegradable plastic, chitosan, collagen, and antibodies. Additionally, various start-ups leading to new beneficial products from agricultural solid waste should be promoted. This review intends to explore the sources of agricultural solid waste generation and to provide a solution to manage the waste through modern technologies, saving the environment and boosting a country’s economy. The outcome of our study will lead toward a sustainable approach to waste management as we have comprises the most innovative and successful working models in one place. This newly developed technique will help to achieve the greater goal of sustainable development.

      "Abstract": "Information theoretic learning plays a very important role in adaption learning systems. Many non-parametric entropy estimators have been proposed by the researchers. This work explores kernel density estimation based on Tsallis entropy. Firstly, it has been proved that for linearly independent samples and for equal samples, Tsallis-estimator is consistent for the PDF and minimum respectively. Also, it is investigated that Tsallisestimator is smooth for differentiable, symmetric, and unimodal kernel function. Further, important properties of Tsallis-estimator such as scaling and invariance for both single and joint entropy estimation have been proved. The objective of the work is to understand the mathematics behind the underlying concept. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "Eco-friendly mortars are produced by replacing Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) partially with Fly Ash, Rice Husk Ash (RHA), Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) etc. in different proportions. Additionally, dense impermeable mortar is produced by including these supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) resulting in much lesser chloride/carbonation ingress, with reduced risks of reinforcement corrosion. The improper mortar mix proportions with ill-followed w/c ratio leads to poor strength, unsightly cracks and other durability problems. This study presents experimental investigations, in Indian context, to explore the feasibility of developing dry mix mortars with SCM- GGBFS and fly ash in different proportions. The studies were limited to water cement ratio of 0.4 to 0.6. The strength parameters of dry mix mortar and its fluctuations have been investigated for different shelf lives of dry mixes. Studies show that standard consistency for composite cement is slightly greater than that of 100% OPC. The delayed pozzolanic activity results in prolonged initial and final setting periods with a minor reduction in compressive strength. The strength of dry mix composite cement mortar remains constant across its 15, 30, and 60-day shelf lives. Better structural integrity with fewer voids and an improved C-S–H gel distribution is confirmed by through FTIR and SEM analysis. The utilization of dry mix mortar has reduced cement consumption, incorporated the wastes and produced almost impermeable mortar with reduced ingress of moisture and subsequent corrosion. This will be financially viable due to mechanization by bulk and specific production at specialized facilities to ensure long term performance of structures. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

      "Abstract": "With the emerging era of E-commerce and online shopping, people are also in a habit to receive default product recommendations on the web pages that they access. Google is already providing such suggestions. Till now recommendations were made only based on previous sentiments or feedback or ratings, but this research has improved the product recommendation method by including one more parameter for the same. This article represents two parameters for making predictions of product allocation to a new customer. These parameters are ratings given by the existing users for that particular product and the region to which the new customer belongs. Following these parameters, a prediction model and an algorithm, Improved_Collab_Similarity, have been implemented. The dataset has been developed where India as a country along with all its States has been considered for products which are popular for their creation based on regional and ancient skills of the people belonging to that area. Results for the mentioned prediction model have been discussed in this article where generally precision increases with the increase in a number of products but at some points, it does not increase when a smaller number of that product was purchased by the customers. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

      "Abstract": "Background Low back pain stands as a prevalent contributor to pain-related disability on a global scale. In addressing chronic low back pain (CLBP), there is a growing emphasis on incorporating psychological strategies into the management process. Among these, pain education interventions strive to reshape pain beliefs and mitigate the perceived threat of pain. This randomized controlled trial sought to assess the effects of pain education on various aspects, including pain levels, disability, quality of life, self-efficacy, and prognostic characteristics in individuals grappling with CLBP. Methods The clinical trial, retrospectively registered with the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/ 2021/08/035963), employed a two-arm parallel randomized design. Ninety-two participants with CLBP were randomly assigned to either the standard physiotherapy care with a pain education program or the control group. Both groups underwent a 6-week intervention. Assessment of pain intensity (using NPRS), disability (using RMDQ), self-efficacy (using the general self-efficacy scale), and well-being (using WHO 5I) occurred both before and after the 6-week study intervention. Findings Post-intervention score comparisons between the groups revealed that the pain education intervention led to a significant reduction in disability compared to the usual standard care at 6 weeks (mean difference 8.2, p < 0.001, effect size Cohen d = 0.75), a decrease in pain intensity (mean difference 3.5, p < 0.001, effect size Cohen d = 0.82), and an improvement in the well-being index (mean difference 13.7, p < 0.001, effect size Cohen d = 0.58). Conclusion The findings suggest that integrating a pain education program enhances the therapeutic benefits of standard physiotherapy care for individuals dealing with chronic LBP. In conclusion, the clinical benefits of pain education become apparent when delivered in conjunction with standard care physiotherapy during the management of chronic low back pain. © 2024 Sidiq et al.

      "Abstract": "Clustering is a popular data analysis technique that can explore the structure of data through cluster analysis. Similar data are put into the same cluster, while dissimilar data allocate to other clusters. The similarity/dissimilarity among data objects is determined using a distance function. Further, clustering algorithms aim to choose the optimal set of centroids for obtaining better partitioning, but clustering accuracy is always susceptible. This issue of clustering is addressed through meta-heuristic algorithms. This research also aims to handle the accuracy issue and presents a new algorithm for effective cluster analysis. The proposed clustering algorithm is inspired by a water flow optimizer (WFO). The WFO algorithm performance is validated on the well-defined clustering problems based on SSE, accuracy (AR) and detection rate (DR) parameters. The results indicate that the WFO algorithm gets higher clustering results in terms of SSE, AR and DR than the same class of algorithms. The performance is also validated using Friedman statistical test followed by a post hoc test. Results indicated that the proposed WFO gets better statistical results than other clustering algorithms. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",

      "Abstract": "The green walnut, which is frequently overlooked in favor of its more mature sibling, is becoming a topic of great significance because of its unique ecological role, culinary flexibility, and therapeutic richness. The investigation of the bioactive substances found in green walnuts and their possible effects on human health has therapeutic potential. Juglans regia L. is an important ecological component that affects soil health, biodiversity, and the overall ecological dynamic in habitats. Comprehending and recording these consequences are essential for environmental management and sustainable land-use strategies. Regarding cuisine, while black walnuts are frequently the main attraction, green walnuts have distinct tastes and textures that are used in a variety of dishes. Culinary innovation and the preservation of cultural food heritage depend on the understanding and exploration of these gastronomic characteristics. Omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals are abundant in green walnuts, which have a comprehensive nutritional profile. Walnuts possess a wide range of pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and cognitive-function-enhancing properties. Consuming green walnuts as part of one’s diet helps with antioxidant defense, cardiovascular health, and general well-being. Juglans regia L., with its distinctive flavor and texture combination, is not only a delicious food but also supports sustainable nutrition practices. This review explores the nutritional and pharmacological properties of green walnuts, which can be further used for studies in various food and pharmaceutical applications. © 2024 by the authors.",

      "Abstract": "We appreciate criticism of our study, and we want to address each issue they brought up. However, rather than trying a thorough investigation of all facets of Earthquake engineering, our study exclusively focused on the practical application of fluid viscous dampers (FVDs) in a G+20 story building under varied loads. We are quite concerned by claims of the presentation of fake technical content because our research was carried out honestly and rigorously. Any unintentional technical errors will be fixed in subsequent releases with the critic's detailed criticism. In terms of due diligence, our study was subject to a thorough peer review before publication, and we are willing to address any issues that may arise. In order to ensure that our conclusions are consistent with the findings of the study, misconceptions and a lack of conclusive data will be thoroughly addressed. We are dedicated to enhancing the calibre of our research and value constructive criticism. © 2024",

      "Abstract": "Stock price forecasting is a crucial area of research that demands a thorough comprehension of market dynamics and sophisticated analytical methods. Deep neural networks have recently demonstrated considerable potential for enabling academics to create extremely precise models for foretelling financial patterns. Another quickly developing technology is Natural language processing (NLP), which is increasingly used to evaluate financial data, notably news, and social media sentiment, and forecast the course of the market. An innovative deep learning-based stock market prediction model is created in this research paper. The historic stock market data and news feed as the information source. The acquired raw data (news data) are pre-processed using lowercase text conversion, punctuation removal, stop word removal, tokenization of sentences, normalization, and a bag of words technique. Then, from the pre-processed news data, the features such as Parts of Speech (PoS), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and N-gram-based features are extracted. In addition, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence oscillator (MACD), and Relative Strength Index (RSI) based features are extracted from the historic stock market data. The extracted features from the historic stock market data and news feeds are fused. The optimal features are then chosen from the fused features using a new hybrid optimization model called Exchange Market Emperor Pigeon Optimization (EMEPO). The proposed EMEPO model is a combination of the standard Exchange Market Algorithm (EMA) and Emperor Pigeon Optimization (EPO). A new three-phase classifier is introduced in this research work, for accurate stock price forecasting. The proposed three-phase classifier includes Convolutional neural networks (CNN), Bidirectional long short-term memories (Bi-LSTM), and Autoencoder. The three-phase classifier is trained using the selected EMEPO-based features. The projected outcome from the three-phase classifier portrays the stock market prices. In all three feature selection events, the suggested method produces positive outcomes. In Case 1 (Open/Close), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) value is 0.051582, suggesting a minimal average difference between the anticipated and actual values. The accuracy of the model in forecasting percentage errors is shown by the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which is 11.28154%. Similar results are obtained by the model in Case 2 (High/Low/Close), with an MAE of 0.056408 and a MAPE of 12.0081%. These results show how well the suggested strategy works for anticipating stock prices with accuracy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",

      "Abstract": "Circular polarization division multiplexing (CPDM) is a pioneering technology that has superiority over linear polarization division multiplexing (LPDM) due to the absence of polarization axis alignment synchronization at the receiver and because it distributes the scattered light evenly. In this work, a wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) 2 × 320 Gbps free space optical (FSO) system has been presented by incorporating CPDM, 256-quadrature amplitude modulation (256-QAM), and digital signal processing (DSP). Moreover, matched filters are employed due to their anti-jamming and noise-cancelation properties. For the investigation of the proposed system at varied FSO ranges in terms of bit error rate (BER) under different weather disturbances, we have considered clear weather, heavy rain, heavy fog, and heavy dust. Results revealed that the proposed system can withstand very high power levels as high as 100 dBm and can cover 38 km under clear weather, 5 km under heavy rain, 3 km under heavy fog, and 400 m under heavy dust at 10–3 BER. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Optical Society of India 2023.",

      "Abstract": "Background/Purpose: Due to the rise in hospitalization morbidity and mortality among the elderly population, balance issues pose a significant problem for healthcare. Studies on the prevention of falls in the elderly have shown that exercise regimens can reduce the risk of falling and improve daily activities. This study aimed to investigate the effect of specific balance training of elderly population on uneven surface in comparison to general balance training on even surface. Methods: The participants were randomly assigned to Group A (floor or even surface training), Group B (Swiss ball training), or Group C (Foam platform training).The Berg Balance Scale, Functional Reach Test, and non-equilibrium coordination test were used for pre-and post-assessment. Results: In the present study, balance and coordination training on floor, swiss ball and foam platform resulted in a significant difference between the pre-and post-assessment of BBS and the coordination of the right and left sides. In addition, functional reach testing (FRT) revealed that while there was a significant improvement following swiss ball and foam platform training, there was no significant change between pre and post assessment after floor training. Conclusion: Balance training on an uneven surface, predominantly a foam platform, led to significant improvements in balance and coordination compared to training on a swiss ball or a flat surface. © 2024, Full Universe Integrated Marketing Limited.

      "Abstract": "With the rapid advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) technologies, contemporary livestock management practices are undergoing a transformation. This research introduces an innovative system dedicated to the real-time monitoring of newborn livestock, particularly focusing on calves. Utilizing the high-speed data transfer capabilities of LiFi and the widespread connectivity features of IoT, the system is designed to capture, transmit, and analyse vital health parameters, such as body temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, and various behavioural markers like movement and sound detection. Our dataset, which includes a variety of calf health scenarios, shows the system's capacity to correctly identify common diseases, probable hunger, cold and shivering, and situations requiring urgent veterinarian attention. Farmers and veterinarians can safeguard the wellbeing of the newborn cattle with real-time input and the capability to remotely monitor circumstances, improving survival rates, health outcomes, and animal welfare. Additionally, by using Li-Fi technology, we can take advantage of its security, effectiveness, and low interference benefits, overcoming some of the drawbacks of conventional wireless monitoring systems. This research paves the way for a holistic approach to newborn livestock care, promising a future where technological innovations align with the needs of sustainable and humane animal husbandry practices. © Engineered Science Publisher LLC 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Emotion detection from text plays a very critical role in different domains, including customer service, social media analysis, healthcare, financial services, education, human-to-computer interaction, psychology, and many more. Nowadays, deep learning techniques become popular due to their capabilities to capture inherent complex insights and patterns from raw data. In this paper, we have used the Word2Vec embedding approach that takes care of the semantic and contextual understanding of text making it more realistic while detecting emotions. These embeddings act as input to the convolution neural network (CNN) to capture insights using feature maps. The Word2Vec and CNN models applied to the international survey on emotion antecedents and reactions (ISEAR) dataset outperform the models in the literature in terms of accuracy and F1-score as model evaluation metrics. The proposed approach not only obtains high accuracy in emotion detection tasks but also generates interpretable representations that contribute to the understanding of emotions in textual data. These findings carry significant implications for applications in diverse domains, such as social media analysis, market research, clinical assessment and counseling, and tailored recommendation systems. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Materials and Methods: Forty‑five children aged 6–10 years were selected for the present randomized control trial. They were split into three groups at random. Group 1 control group: tell‑show‑do, Group 2: audio distraction, and Group 3: VR distraction. Both pretreatment and postoperative anxiety levels were measured by modified Venham’s anxiety rating scale (MVARS). Results: In each of the three groups, there was a statistically significant difference between the child’s pre‑ and post‑treatment anxiety levels. VR distraction group experienced the greatest reduction in anxiety. Conclusion: All three methods were similarly successful at lowering anxiety while virtual reality distraction outperformed compared to other techniques. © 2023 Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences.",

      "Abstract": "Nowadays, grid-tied solar photovoltaic (SPV) and electric vehicles (EV) are escalating owing to the large penetration of EVs into the transportation sector. In addition, the battery energy storage system benefits the EV application by ensuring power under varying supplies. In this proposed work, the honey badger optimization algorithm (HBOA) is used for energy management in battery-connected solar PV. The battery scheduling is done by controlling the DC link voltage using HBOA. The HBOA has better exploration and exploitation behavior; thus, it could not be trapped in the local optima, and the deviation in voltage can be reduced. In the grid-integrated PV system, DC into AC conversion should concern power quality (PQ) and switching frequencies. The static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is connected at the grid side to address this issue. The STATCOM provides rapid regulation of dynamic powers to minimize the harmonics and voltage unbalances. This work proposes the fuzzy fractional order proportional integral derivative (F2OPID) to enhance voltage regulation and reactive power (RP) compensation. The proposed work is implemented on the MATLAB/Simulink tool, and the results are evaluated using existing methods. The results indicate that the proposed method improves the PQ with a lower total harmonic distortion (THD) of 0.76% for voltage and 0.79% for current, respectively. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

      "Abstract": "Superior electrochemical behaviour of Aluminium makes it the perfect metal for use in aluminium air batteries. It is critical to create effective and affordable anodes for Al-air batteries. This study investigates the effects of nickel and nickel-copper electroplated aluminium anodes on battery operation in both alkaline medium KOH and NaOH. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and anodic polarization curves are used to study the corrosion behaviour of prepared samples. The surface morphologies were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The corrosion rate measurements and the constant-voltage discharge measurements were carried out then received data indicated that nickel electroplating increases the efficiency of the aluminium anode more than nickel-copper electroplating. However, it generates a barrier film that shields the aluminium from corrosion without inhibiting battery reactions. © 2023",

      "Abstract": "Surface water pollution has a major role in degrading the water bodies in all aspects, including physical, chemical, and biological. An increase in usage of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, disposal of harmful waste chemicals from industries, and dumping of different inorganic waste ultimately increases the level of chemicals in the water bodies, thus resulting in greater damage to the aquatic life. Plastic waste, especially microplastic pollution, is also one of the major concerns for marine pollution. When dissolved in water, this microplastic releases harmful toxic chemicals that are lethal to flora and fauna. There are many drawbacks of these conventional treatment techniques, including high cost, space requirement, power usage, time-consuming method, and non-specific for certain pollutants, which will decrease the efficiency rate. The release of chemicals and heavy metals like cadmium, lead, and mercury accumulates in the waterbodies and affects not only aquatic life but also human health and the environment. To overcome this problem, various advanced techniques like activated sludge, rapid sand filtering, membrane bioreactor, etc., are used to remove the pollutants from the water bodies. This review focuses on the modern techniques that are found to be more efficient, eco-friendly, consume less energy, and are more reliable. © 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.",

      "Abstract": "The term 'metaverse' is being spoken around often in the IT sector. Investments, startups constructing components, new platform announcements, and major corporations joining this realm of digital interaction are constantly in the news. There is a great deal of momentum towards a nearly natural 3D virtual environment, and the clarion cry may have led to Facebook renaming as Meta, which may be recognized as a watershed point in the development of the Metaverse. One can work, play, and socialize in the Metaverse at any time, from any location, using whatever device you want. Users can engage in real-time interactions by merging physical, augmented, and virtual realities. It is a game-changer in digital connection, with boundless, unrealized potential and enormous commercial prospects. In this chapter, the researchers explore the meaning of the metaverse, its use in different fields, and its advantages.

      "Abstract": "The overview of green composites presented here provides a comprehensive research overview covering the fabrication, characterization, evaluation, and application prospects of green composites. Green composites derived from sustainable and renewable sources have received a great deal of attention due to their potential to reduce environmental impact. The manufacturing process involves blending natural fibres such as jute, flax, and bamboo with biodegradable polymer matrices such as PLA and PHA. This synthesis has been explored through various techniques such as compression moulding, extrusion and 3D printing to ensure optimal material compatibility and mechanical properties. Characterization techniques include mechanical, thermal, and morphological analyses. Tensile, flexural, and impact tests evaluate the strength, elasticity, and toughness of composites, while thermal studies examine stability at various temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy provides insight into fibre-matrix interfacial bonding and composite microstructure. Evaluation of these green composites includes evaluation of environmental friendliness, recyclability and biodegradability. Life cycle assessments quantify environmental impacts and increase sustainability attractiveness. Along with environmental friendliness, the mechanical performance, degradation behaviour, and cost-effectiveness of the composite are also considered. Application prospects span a variety of industries. The automotive, construction, packaging, and consumer goods industries benefit from these composites due to their light weight, improved mechanical properties, and reduced carbon footprint. Their integration into existing manufacturing processes has been explored and their potential to replace conventional materials without sacrificing performance has been demonstrated. In summary, this study provides a holistic understanding of environmentally friendly composites, covering the entire lifecycle from fabrication to potential applications. This result highlights the feasibility of these composites as a sustainable alternative to promote greener practices across multiple industries. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Vikas Dhawan, Atul Babbar, Inderdeep Singh, and Jonathan M.

      "Abstract": "Photo-thermal-catalysts (PTC) exceptional features and ability to concurrently solve sustainable energy requirements and environmental problems have drawn scientific interest. The photo-thermal effect is the process by which photo-thermal conversion materials transform radiant energy from light into thermal energy. The photo-thermal therapy of energy and environmental treatment faces the urgent task of developing effective photo-thermal agents to address complicated problem demands. In this study, we take a look at the fundamental principles and underlying process of photo-thermal material catalysis. In addition, this review provides a concise summary of the most up-to-date findings concerning photo-thermal catalysis materials, which have been aggressively researched for a wide-spread sustainable energy and environment treatment uses. In order to motivate the creation of a high-efficiency photo-thermal catalytic pathway, the criteria and techniques for designing photo-thermal catalysts are presented. This will make it possible for a better absorption of the whole spectrum of solar energy as well as a greater conversion of solar energy to heat. Theoretical direction is offered for the continued development of this technology, and the promise of the practical use of photo-thermal catalysis for different solar-driven interfacial photo-thermal conversion technologies is anticipated. This paper offers a unique perspective on photo-thermal catalysis focussing on the synergistic effects and suggesting a potential route for future applications.

      "Abstract": "Grit is an impeccable concept which addresses the consistency of interest and perseverance of effort among non-disabled athletes in the existing literature. However, a dearth of research has scrutinised this construct among disabled athletes. The purpose of this research is to explore the challenges of the gritty para-athletes and the reasons behind their grittiness within each narrative type. Two-part life history interviews were conducted with para elite track and field athletes (n=30). The interviews were transcribed and subjected to a dialogical narrative analysis. The speculation was drawn on the stories told by the para-athletes which were based on the grounds of understanding grit and how their life experiences have shaped their grittiness. Five distinct narrative typologies were identified: staying a little longer, quit quitting, a superman story, embracing uncertainty, rising from ashes and everything to me narrative. Grit is inevitable in achieving success but there are many underlying factors which influences grit such as social support, resilience, determination etc. Hence, creating and sharing narratives of gritty para-athletes can help other para-athletes to make sense of their challenges in meaningful and diverse ways. Future implications address the need for the development of the grit-based interventions that can flourish the mental and physical well-being of para-athletes. © 2024 by authors, all rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "Haplophyllum tuberculatum (Forssk.) A.Juss. volatile oils were obtained by distillation of the aerial parts of the plant growing in Libya during the summer and spring seasons. A yield and componential analysis revealed that the summer season oil, which is frequently used in traditional medicaments by North African communities, was high in yield (0.858%) compared to the spring season oil (0.47%), and distinguished by the presence of major and various diverse constituents, some of which are considered chemical markers. Owing to the traditional and high incidence of use of the summer-produced essential oil for the treatment of several disorders, including hepatic diseases, and fatigue, the oil was pharmacologically investigated for its varied bioactivities of anti-microbial, in vivo anti-oxidant, and in vitro anti-cancer properties. Thirty-three compounds were identified and represented 96.2% of the peaks in the GC-chromatogram of the summer oil, in which the major volatile constituents were δ-3-carene (21.5%), bornyl acetate (16.9%), and limonene aldehyde (15.2%). The summer-based essential oil of the plant demonstrated moderate anti-bacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and a relatively strong antibacterial effect against Gram-negative bacteria as compared to the positive antibacterial controls, ampicillin and gentamicin, respectively. Also, antifungal activity against Aspergillus sp. was observed. The summer-produced oil also exhibited in vivo antioxidant and in vitro anti-cancer activities. © 2024 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.",

      "Abstract": "Materials have been an important part of human life from its very existence. Especially metals have played a vital role in the development of human kind. From tools to utensils, metals have been used extensively. In today’s scenario, pure metals and metal alloys have become a bit less popular as compared to metal matrix composites (MMCs). This has happened because of the extraordinary properties possessed by MMCs. Properties such as high compressive and yield strength, good creep and wear resistance, good fatigue and corrosion resistance, ability to withstand high temperatures, high thermal conductivity and low coefficient of thermal expansion make MMCs suitable for most demanding applications such as aerospace, defense, surgical, automobile, structural and thermal management applications. MMCs have gained popularity over the years due to above-mentioned properties which distinguish them from pure metals and traditional alloys which possess very few of them taken together. There are several ways for the synthesis of MMCs such as sintering, powder metallurgy (P/M), squeeze casting, liquid infiltration and stir casting. This paper presents the latest developments in the field of metal matrix composites reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) including synthesis and applications. Some of the classical papers from the past have also been included to present a comprehensive picture as far as microstructure and alignment of CNT within the metal matrix is concerned.

      "Abstract": "The alarming rise of pathogen antibiotic resistance presents a major global health challenge and demands a novel way to control the microbial infections. Simultaneously, nanotechnology has found numerous uses in electrical as well as electronic systems, including timing, filtering, power factor adaptation, and capacitors for energy storage. This work investigates the synthesis and characterization of a silver nanoparticle (AgNPs) utilizing Calotropis procera (CPL) leaf extract. The optimization of synthesis process and the reduction of nanoparticles (NPs) were validated by UV–visible spectroscopy. AgNPs' was exhaustively characterized for morphology, crystallinity, zeta-potential, and structural properties. The produced NPs demonstrated a wide range of characteristics, such as antioxidant, antidiabetic, antibacterial, and antifungal effects. Furthermore, remarkable electrochemical performance was indicated by the CPL-AgNPs electrode, which has mesoporous, clustered sphere-shaped particles onto a flexible stainless-steel substrate. This highlights the electrode's potential in energy storage applications. Copper monosulfide served as the anode and CPL-AgNPs as the cathode electrode in tested hybrid supercapacitor devices, which proved remarkable specific capacitances, high specific energy, and exceptionally high specific power. In order to address the twin challenges of antimicrobial resistance alongside advanced energy storage, this study provides a novel and thorough analysis of the basic electrochemistry as well biological properties of AgNPs, clarifying their potential storage of charges mechanisms and biomedical applications.

      "Abstract": "Background: Badminton, a dynamic sport, demands players to display exceptional physical attributes such as agility, core stability, and reaction time. Backward walking training on a treadmill has garnered attention for its potential to enhance physical attributes and optimize performance in athletes while minimizing the risk of injuries. Objective: By investigating the efficacy of this novel approach, we aim to provide valuable insights to optimize training regimens and contribute to the advancement of sports science in badminton. Methodology: Sixty-four participants were randomized into a control group (n = 32) and an experimental group (n = 32). The control group received routine exercise training, while the experimental group received routine exercise training along with additional backward walking training on the treadmill. Pre- and post-intervention measurements were taken for core stability using the Plank test, balance using the Star Excursion Balance test, reaction time using the 6-point footwork test, and agility using the Illinois Agility test. Results: The results showed that the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in core stability (p < 0.001), balance (p < 0.001), reaction time (p < 0.05), and agility (p < 0.001) compared to the control group. The backward walking training proved to be effective in enhancing these physical attributes in badminton players. Conclusion: Incorporating backward walking exercises into the training regimen of badminton players may contribute to their overall performance. © The Author(s) 2024.",

      "Abstract": "The labor-intensive, time-consuming, and uneconomical nature of manually extracting banana (Musa acuminata) fibers from pseudo-stem sheaths has prompted the exploration of automation as a solution. This study focuses on automating the feeding process of banana pseudostem sheaths using a quick return mechanism, which is more effective than other approaches. A comprehensive study was conducted to assess the impact of key process parameters, namely the decorticator (480–540 rpm), roller speed (50–80 rpm), and clearance between rollers (2–4 mm), on the mechanical properties of the extracted banana fiber. The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed for the experimental design and analysis of data, and the mechanical properties under investigation included the tensile strength, Young's modulus, and strain percentage of the banana fiber. The results revealed that the decorticator speed, roller speed, and clearance between rollers are significantly influenced by their mechanical properties. Herein, the optimal process parameter values are identified as follows: a decorticator speed of 510 rpm, roller speed of 65 rpm, and clearance of 3 mm between rollers. The mechanical characterization of the optimized banana fiber exhibited impressive properties, with an ultimate tensile strength of 679.48 MPa, Young's modulus of 25.47 GPa, and strain of 3 %. This study demonstrates that automation coupled with systematic parameter optimization can enhance the mechanical attributes of banana fibers. This research not only addresses the challenges of manual extraction, but also advances the understanding of how process parameters affect banana fiber quality, thereby facilitating the utilization of this natural fiber in various industrial applications. © 2024 The Authors",

      "Abstract": "Ready-to-eat food products are becoming a necessity. Bread is the most consumed and easily available product used for breakfast in several households. In this study, mango bread was developed by incorporating whole wheat flour into brown rice flour. The mango breads were formulated with different levels of brown rice flour incorporation (0, 20, 40, and 60 %), and the breads were abbreviated as MB0, MB1, MB2, and MB3, respectively. The findings of the study revealed that with the increase in the concentration of brown rice flour, there was an increase in the ash and fiber contents, which increased from 0.85 to 3.58 % and 0.86 to 1.76 %, respectively. Increasing the concentration of brown rice flour increased hardness, whereas gumminess, chewiness, stickiness, and adhesiveness decreased proportionately. The results showed that brown rice flour could be an effective ingredient by missing it in whole wheat flour up to a level of 40 % to yield breads of acceptable sensory attributes with average liking sensory scores of 7 (like moderately) and above. © 2024 The Author(s)",

      "Abstract": "Background: Cleft lip and palate (CLP) are among the most common congenital anomaly that affects up to 33,000 newborns in India every year. Nasoalveolar moulding (NAM) is a non-surgical treatment performed between 0 and 6 months of age to reduce the cleft and improve nasal aesthetics prior to lip surgery. The NAM treatment has been a controversial treatment option with 51% of the cleft teams in Europe, 37% of teams in the USA and 25 of cleft teams in India adopting this methodology. This treatment adds to the already existing high burden of care for these patients. Furthermore, the supporting evidence for this technique is limited with no high-quality long-term clinical trials available on the effectiveness of this treatment. Method: The NAMUC study is an investigator-initiated, multi-centre, single-blinded randomized controlled trial with a parallel group design. The study will compare the effectiveness of NAM treatment provided prior to lip surgery against the no-treatment control group in 274 patients with non-syndromic unilateral complete cleft lip and palate. The primary endpoint of the trial is the nasolabial aesthetics measured using the Asher McDade index at 5 years of age. The secondary outcomes include dentofacial development, speech, hearing, cost-effectiveness, quality of life, patient perception, feeding and intangible benefits. Randomization will be carried out via central online system and stratified based on cleft width, birth weight and clinical trial site. Discussion: We expect the results from this study on the effectiveness of treatment with NAM appliance in the long term along with the cost-effectiveness evaluation can eliminate the dilemma and differences in clinical care across the globe. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov CTRI/2022/11/047426 (Clinical Trials Registry India). Registered on 18 November 2022. The first patient was recruited on 11 December 2022.

      "Abstract": "Proteins are usually composed of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, resulting in too many amino acid molecules with interlinked peptide bonds. A careful analysis of other protein-rich choices is required because of the depletion of conventional protein resources and the need to meet the dietary demands of the increasing global population. The prime motive for creating concentrates and isolates from a protein source is to increase the concentration of proteins by removing non-protein constituents, allowing the use of a lower amount of protein for food formulation to provide specific nutritional and functional properties. Protein concentrates are a possible alternative that come from a range of sources, including dairy products, plants, and insects. Their extraction strategies, which range from conventional solvent extraction to cutting-edge approaches, such as membrane separation and enzyme-assisted procedures, provide opportunities to maximize yield, maintain nutritional value, and reduce environmental impact. These concentrates are used in the food sector to improve dietary profiles, formulate functional foods, and meet growing demand for plant-based and alternative protein sources. This review advances our understanding of this crucial element in the search for nutrient-dense and sustainable protein sources by clarifying their origins, extraction techniques, and uses. © 2024",

      "Abstract": "This article presents a comprehensive study on the evaluation of the performance of modified binders and Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) in Open-Graded Friction Course (OGFC) and Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) mixtures. The goal of the research is to enhance the longevity of asphalt pavements as well as their resistance to rutting and environmental conditions. In addition to the use of cellulose Fibre as a stabiliser and hydrated lime as a filler and anti-stripping agent, a total of five distinct binders, including plain bitumen, polymer-modified binder (PMB-40), crumb rubber-modified binder (CRMB-55), and WMA-E and WMA-Z (produced by adding Evotherm and Zycotherm additives in PMB-40), have been utilised. The study sheds light on the efficiency of these binders in the production of high-quality OGFC and SMA mixes and compares their performance with that of traditional asphalt. The mixtures’ resistance to rutting and durability is evaluated by a series of performance tests that are part of the laboratory examination. Pavement performance in terms of pavement stiffness, moisture susceptibility, elasticity property, permanent deformation, and rut depth of mixtures is measured. The results show the implementation of modified binders and WMA technology in OGFC and SMA mixtures in cost-effective solutions for high-volume road networks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

      "Abstract": "The effect of the incorporation of roasted garden cress seed powder (RGCSP) in the diet of girls with anaemia on Hb level and quality was evaluated. Twenty-two girls were selected and their Hb levels were estimated. Out of twenty-two girls, fifteen girls were found to be anemic and were selected for the study and it was found that four girls had mild, nine had moderate and two had severe degree of anaemia. The girls' average Hb levels dramatically raised from 8.9 to 10.4 g/dL following a 60-day intervention that also included RGCSP. Research on garden cress seed powder (GCSP) showed that roasting decreased the amount of moisture, protein, carbohydrate, and zinc while increasing the amount of ash, fat, crude fiber, and iron. Four distinct formulations were created with various amounts of GCSP (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 %) to generate fortified chikki. The chikki with 15 % GCSP had the highest overall acceptance rating of among them. Compared to the control chikki, this enriched variety had higher percentages of protein (6.95 %), fat (15.87 %), moisture (4.60 %), fiber (3.95 %), and calorie content (456.23 kcal/100 g). Supplemented chikki made by fortifying with RGCSP was rich in nutritional composition. © 2024",

      "Abstract": "The aim of the present work is to understand the complex relationship between amino acids including glycine, alanine, 2-aminobutyric acid, leucine and methionine in natural soil and soil amended with pesticide. Soil samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction technique (XRD). The soil thin layer chromatography method was used to study the adsorption behaviour and mobility of amino acids on natural soil and in soil amended with chlorpyrifos. Results found that the overall percentage change in Rf values from sample without chlorpyrifos and sample with 8 % chlorpyrifos is 37.5% for glycine (lowest molecular weight) and 10% for methionine (highest molecular weight). However, for the rest of the three amino acids, it was in the range of 14-15%. Chlorpyrifos is found to decrease the mobility of five amino acids in soil by making them more adsorbed on soil surface. Adsorption of amino acids is a key contributor for plant nutrition. In the present study, lowest mobility was found for glycine in pure soil and in soil amended with chlorpyrifos indicating maximum adsorption on soil surface. In future studies, adsorption performance of amino acids on soil can be analysed in presence of various additives. Keeping in view the significant effects of amino acids and pesticides on soil and plant health, it is estimated that this technology can be applied for further investigation in different fields of soil engineering. © 2024, Malaysian Society of Soil Science.

      "Abstract": "Pain in the lower back is a major concern in today’s era due to prolonged sitting in two-wheeler riders, mainly due to hamstring tightness. It also creates physical disability and impairment in activities of daily living. The study aimed to compare the efficacy of muscle energy technique (MET) and self-myofascial release (SMFR) using the foam roller on hamstring flexibility, dynamic balance, and physical disability amongst two-wheeler riders with chronic low back pain (LBP). Participants were randomized into two intervention groups, MET and SMFR using the envelope method, with each group having 20 participants. Hamstring flexibility and range of motion for knee extension and the lower back were assessed using the active knee extension test (AKE-L and AKE-R) and sit and reach test (SRT), while the dynamic balance was assessed by the star excursion balance test (SEBT) and physical disability by Roland‐Morris Disability Questionnaire, (RMDQ). Measurements were taken at baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention. This study demonstrated that both SMFR using a foam roller and MET are effective in enhancing hamstring muscle flexibility, (SRT—F(1, 38) = 299.5, p < 0.001; AKE-R—F(1, 38) = 99.53, p < 0.001; AKE-L—F(1, 38) = 89.67, p < 0.001). Additionally, these techniques significantly improved dynamic balance in various directions, including anterior (ANT), anteromedial (AMED), medial (MED), posteromedial (PMED), posterior (POST), posterolateral (PLAT), lateral (LAT), and anterolateral (ALAT) directions (p < 0.01). Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in physical disability (RMDQ—F(1, 38) = 1307, p < 0.001), among two-wheeler riders suffering from chronic LBP. Compared to MET, SMFR using foam rollers was found to be more effective in enhancing hamstring flexibility, improving balance, and decreasing disability level on the RMDQ after 4 weeks. © The Author(s) 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Background: Based on the present global burden of oral diseases, unmet dental needs affect a more significant population worldwide. It is characterised by the need for dental care but receiving delayed or no care. The contributing factors include lack of knowledge about oral health, its consequences, and the availability of dental services. We need to find out the scale of the problem of unmet dental needs for the south Indian population. Therefore, the objective was to determine the relationship between the presence of oral disease and the quality of life-related to oral health using the OHIP-14 tool. Methods: The unmet dental requirements of the south Indian population were determined using a cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Close-ended questions were used to obtain data from two investigators trained to record the answers from the patients. The data was collected using the OHIP-14 questionnaire, which consists of 14 items divided into seven domains with two questions each. Physical pain, psychological impairment, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability, and disability were all considered. An additional analysis of artificial neural network (ANN) was done. Results: The response rate was 100 per cent. N = 1029 people replied to the questionnaire about their unmet dental needs. N = 497 (48.3%) were men, whereas N = 532 (51.7%) were women. The average age was 31.7811.72. As their current occupation, most of the included subjects (60.1%) were students. The respondents had no known personal habits and a mixed diet (94.93%). The average BMI was 24.022.59 (14-30.9). OHIP was present in 62.3% of the population. The average OHIP-14 severity score was 10.97. (8.54). The severity and degree of unmet dental need were substantial (p0.01) due to pain in the mouth/teeth/gums, malocclusion, and gum bleeding. The most common OHIP-14 domains affected by unmet oral needs were psychological discomfort, psychological limitation, social limitation, and feeling handicapped. The analysis of ANN revealed that high OHIP scores were primarily attributed to dental caries, poor oral health, and dental aesthetics. Conclusion: The severity and degree of unmet dental needs were significant among the south Indian population. The most common oral health status that impacted OHIP-14 domains were pain, malocclusion, and bleeding gums. These patients were significantly impacted by psychological discomfort and social limitations and felt handicapped. © The Author(s) 2024.",

      "Abstract": "The present study deals with the assessment of different physicochemical parameters (pH, electrical conductivity (E.C.), turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and dissolved oxygen) in different surface water such as pond, river, and canal water in four different seasons, viz. March, June, September, and December 2023. The research endeavors to assess the impact of a cationic polyelectrolyte, specifically poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDADMAC), utilized as a coagulation aid in conjunction with lime for water treatment. Employing a conventional jar test apparatus, turbidity removal from diverse water samples is examined. Furthermore, the samples undergo characterization utilizing X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The study also conducts correlation analyses on various parameters such as electrical conductivity (EC), pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity of raw water, polyelectrolyte dosage, and percentage of turbidity removal across different water sources. Utilizing the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software, these analyses aim to establish robust relationships among initial turbidity, temperature, percentage of turbidity removal, dosage of coagulant aid, electrical conductivity, and total dissolved solids (TDS) in pond water, river water, and canal water. A strong positive correlation could be found between the percentage of turbidity removal and the value of initial turbidity of all surface water. However, a negative correlation could be observed between the polyelectrolyte dosage and raw water’s turbidity. By elucidating these correlations, the study contributes to a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of PDADMAC and lime in water treatment processes across diverse environmental conditions. This research enhances our comprehension of surface water treatment methodologies and provides valuable insights for optimizing water treatment strategies to address the challenges posed by varying water sources and seasonal fluctuations.

      "Abstract": "Information-theoretic measures play a vital role in training learning systems. Many researchers proposed non-parametric entropy estimators that have applications in adaptive systems. In this work, a kernel density estimator using Kapur entropy of order α and type β has been proposed and discussed with the help of theorems and properties. From the results, it has been observed that the proposed density measure is consistent, minimum, and smooth for the probability density function (PDF) underlying given conditions and validated with the help of theorems and properties. The objective of the paper is to understand the theoretical viewpoint behind the underlying concept. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "The trade history of India with European Union countries, particularly the United Kingdom (UK), is well established. India has regularly maintained a trade surplus with the UK since the fiscal year 2004–2005, in contrast to its trade relations with the rest of the globe. This study seeks to delve into India's trade potential with the UK, focusing on the HS-2 digit (Harmonized System) over the period 2001–2021. This research employs several trade indices to gather insights into the shared trade potential between two nations. The study's findings explain that India's trade intensity with the UK is comparatively lower when contrasted with its trade patterns with other global partners. The results of the Revealed Comparative Advantage and Trade Potential index indicate numerous sectors where India can seize opportunities to enhance its trade with the UK. In summary, the study emphasizes that although trade between India and the UK has been growing gradually, there is still unrealized potential that may result in greater welfare gains for both countries. This study identified a significant research gap that needs to be investigated. In conclusion, the study makes a strong case for the anticipated economic integration, which is best illustrated by the creation of a Free Trade Agreement between India and the UK, as a promising opportunity for the improvement of both countries. This proposed FTA represents a perfect example of a win‒win situation in which both parties stand to gain significantly and witness a boost in their overall economic well-being. © 2024 Malque Publishing.

      "Abstract": "Context-: Sacroiliac (SI) joint dysfunction accounts for altered postural stability which can cause a continuously intense pain level and range of disabilities. Aim: To investigate the correlation of postural stability with pain, disability & QOL among sufferers of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Setting: This cross-sectional research was undertaken at Rehabilitation Centre, Jamia Hamdard University. Method: A total of fifty participants were recruited using sample of convenience according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After obtaining informed consent, three pain provocative tests and one motion palpation test were used to determine sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Humac balance master system (CSMi USB powered, Stoughton, USA), Visual analogue scale (VAS), modified Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) & WHO QOL-BREF (US version) were used to assess postural stability, pain, disability & Quality of life (QOL) respectively. Data analysis was done for correlation by SPSS version 24.0. Result: Strong positive correlations were found between reaction time, VAS (r = 0.791) and modified ODI score (r = 0.576) and weak positive correlations between eyes closed solid surface (ECSS) component of modified clinical test of sensory interaction & balance with VAS (r = 0.333) and with modified ODI score (r = 0.304) and eyes open foam surface (EOFS) component with environmental component of QOL (r = 0.287). There were negative correlations between reaction time, physical health (r = −0.413), psychological health (r = −0.375), social relations (r = −0.305), and environment (r = −0.379) parameters of QOL. Conclusion: According to the findings of the study, there were positive correlations of reaction time with pain and disability and negative correlations with QOL. Awareness of clinicians regarding the altered postural stability can help in improvising the assessment and treatment protocols for patients of SI dysfunction. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

      "Abstract": "Nowadays, people are more aware about healthy foods based on bioactive compounds as they are known as functional and nutraceuticals. Encapsulation is a well-known technique for delivering functional bioactive compounds at the right site and at the right time. Valuable bioactive compounds (core) are enclosed in a protective layer (wall). The encapsulation has applications in various sectors such as pharmaceutical, food, and chemical industries. The core and wall are the main structural elements of encapsulation; and based on this the encapsulation is categorized as macro-, micro-, and nanoencapsulation (based on the capsule size). For encapsulating an active compound there are various techniques available such as spray drying, freeze-drying, spray-freeze drying, super critical fluid technology, electrohydrodynamic technique, refractance window drying, molecular inclusion complex, liposome inclusion complexation, and hydrogel. This chapter briefly explains the emerging techniques in encapsulation and their various applications. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Soumya Ranjan Purohit, Vasudha Sharma, Meena Kumari, Kasi Muthukumarappan and Joanna Kane-Potaka.

To address this issue countries are working toward green energy-based transportation, and among all viable solutions electric vehicles (EVs) are emerging as front runners. Range anxiety is one of the most prominent concerns in EV adoption. The range of a vehicle depends on the energy consumption so it becomes crucial to estimate it very precisely. There are many standard drive cycles such as the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and Worldwide harmonized Light-duty Vehicle Test Cycles (WLTC) which are used for the estimation of energy consumption. However, these standard cycles fail to capture the driving behavior of real traffic. Due to this reason, these standard cycles underestimate the energy consumption compared with actual consumption. For more realistic energy requirement estimations, researchers are focusing on the development of real-world drive cycles specific to a particular geography. In this paper, a real-world drive cycle of electric two-wheeler has been developed for the city of Lucknow, India, and compared with the driving characteristics and energy consumption estimates of WLTC. The energy requirement per km for the Lucknow drive cycle and WLTC are found as 14.89 Wh/km and 11.95 Wh/km, respectively, which indicates per km energy required estimation for LDC is 24.60% higher than WLTC. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

      "Abstract": "Aging is the process of gradual physio-biochemical deterioration. Although aging is inevitable, healthy aging is the key to individual and communal well-being. Therefore, it is essential to understand the regulation of aging. SIN-3/Sin-3 is a unique regulatory protein that regulates aging without DNA-binding activity. It functions by establishing multiple protein interactions. To understand the functional mechanism of this transcriptional regulator, the Caenorhabditis elegans protein interactome was assessed for SIN-3 interactions. DAF-16/FOXO emerged as one of the leading contenders for SIN-3-mediated regulation of aging. This study looks at the concerted role of SIN-3 and DAF-16 proteins in lifespan regulation. Phenotypic profiling for the mutants of these genes shows the functional accord between these 2 proteins with similar functions in stress response and vital biological processes. However, there were no significant physical interactions when checked for protein-protein interaction between SIN-3 and DAF-16 proteins. C. elegans genomics and transcriptomics data also indicated the possibilities of concerted gene regulation. This genetic regulation is more likely related to SIN-3 dominance on DAF-16 function. Overall, SIN-3 and DAF-16 proteins have strong functional interactions that ensure healthy aging. The influence of SIN-3 on DAF-16-mediated stress response is one of their convergence points in longevity regulation. © The Author(s) 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Food packaging technology is changing significantly from its conventional protective role to one that is more interactive, and communication driven. The goal is to enhance the safety and quality of the food by regular monitoring during the supply chain. Natural food colorants such as carotenoids are being increasingly explored for its potential application in the smart packaging films as an alternative to the synthetic dyes. In addition to adding color, these carotenoids improve the nutritional content and are known to impart health promoting elements to the food. The fruits and vegetables serve to be a rich source of carotenoids. Incorporated carotenoids act as sensor or indicator, allowing for the real-time monitoring of food quality parameters such as microbial growth, physiological changes, freshness, and physicochemical attributes. This property of carotenoids have drawn the attention of consumers, food industries and scientific community. In addition, carotenoids are known for its antioxidant, anti-microbial property which are known to benefit food matrix in increasing its shelf life. The inclusion of carotenoids has been shown to positively influence the mechanical, thermal and barrier properties of packaging films. Given the significance of aforementioned background, the present review aims to compile the recent studies and investigations made on the potential use of carotenoids in food packaging as smart indicator. Further it also captures the sources and extraction methodologies presently available for the enhanced recovery process. It also provides the future line of work for the commercial realization of carotenoids based smart packaging. This review article is aimed at summarizing the existing current state of knowledge on the carotenoids application in smart packaging systems and does not claim to be systematic or complete. © 2024",

      "Abstract": "Recognizing emotions in textual data is crucial in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) applications, from consumer sentiment research to mental health evaluation. The word embedding techniques play a pivotal role in text processing. In this paper, the performance of several well-known word embedding methods is evaluated in the context of emotion recognition. The classification of emotions is further enhanced using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model because of its propensity to capture local patterns and its recent triumphs in text-related tasks. The integration of CNN with word embedding techniques introduced an additional layer to the landscape of emotion detection from text. The synergy between word embedding techniques and CNN harnesses the strengths of both approaches. CNNs extract local patterns and features from sequential data, making them well-suited for capturing relevant information within the embeddings. The results obtained with various embeddings highlight the significance of choosing synergistic combinations for optimum performance. The combination of CNNs and word embeddings proved a versatile and effective approach. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "The human brain comprises a complex interconnection of nerve cells and vital organs, which regulates crucial bodily processes. Although neurons commonly undergo developmental stages, they may occasionally experience abnormalities, leading to abnormal growths known as brain tumors. The objective of brain tumor segmentation is to produce precise boundaries of brain tumor regions. This study extensively analyzes deep learning methods for brain tumor detection, evaluating their effectiveness across diverse datasets. It introduces a hybrid model, which is proposed by the name HybriCSF: hybrid convolutional-SVM-fuzzy C-means model combining convolutional neural network (CNN) with the classifier support vector machine (SVM) and clustering technique fuzzy C-means (FCM). The proposed model was implemented on Br35H, BraTs 2020 and BraTs2021 datasets. The suggested model outperformed the existing methods by achieving 98.6% of accuracy on Br35H dataset and dice score of 0.63, 0.87, 0.81 on BraTs 2020 dataset for enhancing tumor (ET), whole tumor (WT), and tumor core (TC), respectively. The achieved dice scores on the BraTs 2021datasets are 0.89, 0.95, and 0.89 for ET, WT, and TC, respectively. The results show that the suggested model HybriCSF outperforms the other CNN-based models in terms of accuracy. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "The use of medium and low-grade iron ore is gradually becoming more important due to the depletion of high-grade iron ore reserves and stringent environmental acts/rules. Slimes from iron ore washing were discarded in tailing dams; however, there is currently consideration for recovering iron values from ultra-fines as well. There are enormous fine dumps that are still unutilised. Hence, this study attempt to delve the optimization of iron ore slimes an indeed requirement for manufacturing and design in industries. Leveraging a flocculation process, coupled with the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) predictive model, the Kiriburu processing plant serves as the primary source for iron ore slime samples. Chemical analyses of the collected iron samples reveal a composition featuring 58.24 % iron content, 3.47 % Al2O3, 4.72 % SiO2, and 5.18 % LOI (Loss on Ignition). The investigation explores the performance of the flocculation technique under varying pH levels, different pulp densities, and diverse flocculant dosages. Furthermore, the varying parameters selected are pH from 6 to 11, pulp density from 1 % to 15 %, and flocculant dose from 0.03 to 0.27 mg/g. The study's findings showcase a substantial improvement in the Fe grade of iron ore, escalating from 58.24 % to 66.12 %, with an impressive recovery rate of 82.54 % achieved using a flocculant dosage of 0.09 mg/g at pH 10. Additionally, a performance assessment of the selective flocculation method for iron ore slimes is conducted using an ANN predictive model, with recovery as the pivotal parameter. The input parameters for this model encompass pH, pulp density, and flocculant dosages. Employing a three-layer ANN model with a 3–3–1 architecture and utilizing feed-forward back propagation, the study demonstrates a close alignment between predicted values and experimental data, confirming the model's effectiveness for practical manufacturing applications. Information regarding the potential applications of the model's iron ore slime beneficiation efficacy for the manufacturing sector should be considered. This could entail lower waste, more effectiveness, or cost savings. Emphasise any possible ramifications for sustainability or the environment that would make the study pertinent in a larger perspective. © 2024 The Authors",

      "Abstract": "Remediation of organic and inorganic waste contamination is a growing concern in the environmental sector, while biomedical researchers face challenges in targeting drug delivery for specific diseases. Nanotechnology, particularly the use of polymeric nano-sponges (NS), has emerged as a highly competitive and rapidly evolving solution in both drug delivery and environmental cleanup. NS are three-dimensional nonporous structures developed by extensive polymer cross-linking, forming small cavities capable of encapsulating hydrophilic/hydrophobic compounds. This innovative approach shows promise in overcoming the limitations of traditional medications, often associated with significant side effects. A particularly exciting application of NS is in targeted pharmaceutical delivery, offering potential improvements in the quality of life for cancer and cardiac patients. Additionally, NS have garnered attention for their ability to facilitate environmental cleanup, including oil-water separations and the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants from water, owing to their exceptional sorption capability. Polymer cross-linked NS thus hold immense potential in addressing some of society's most pressing challenges, with continued research and development in this field promising groundbreaking solutions for multifaceted applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",

      "Abstract": "Due to yearly uneven rainfall distribution, exsiccation of water availability, specifically during the summer in the agricultural field in Saurashtra, is a usual scenario. Saurashtra region's land formation contains Basalt rock. The area is categorized under the semi-arid region. Hence, the Groundwater condition was observed to be poor as the self-characteristic of land for water-storage capacity for the Basalt is negligible within its strata. Mining Engineering and Groundwater Improvement Techniques were incorporated to find a way out of water stress conditions. An experimental study was carried out for mass blasting with the permission of the Government body and an expert team of mining explosions at the study area within the catchment of check dams and river beds. A group containing five borewells was blasted at a 27, 18, and 9 m depth, respectively. In each borehole, 15 blasts of 2.76 unit explosion were exploded together by sealing a cover of sand over it. The impact assessment of 30 wells was monitored Post-blast within the range of 400m of the Bore Blasting Technique (BBT) performed. As a result, a rise in water level up to 19m has been recorded near the streamline of BBT performed. In addition, the movement of the water was diverted from its parental aquifer to the observed dug wells. Hence, it is concluded that channelizing the groundwater can be possible by incorporating BBT in the basalt region, and identical improvement can also possible interms of fractured basalt rock and availability of water in the basalt region. © 2024 The author(s).

      "Abstract": "For hard-to-cut materials and composites abrasive water jet machine (AWJM) has been identified as a lucrative and competent material removal technique, in which a high-speed jet of abrasive and water strikes the workpiece surface to erode the desired material. In this paper, the influence of key input parameters (water pressure, standoff distance, traverse rate and abrasive mass flow rate) on responses such as surface roughness (Ra), kerf taper (Kt), and maximum delamination length (Max. DLL) of machined specimen during AWJM of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite is examined through experimental investigations. Response surface methodology (RSM) based central composite design (CCD) approach and Taguchi design based L16 orthogonal array is used for experimentation. Moreover, a hybrid approach of RSM-Desirability and Taguchi Methodology-Grey Relational Analysis (TM-GRA) are used for Multi-response optimization (MRO) and their results are compared for evaluation of process parameters of AWJM on GFRP. Confirmation tests are carried out to validate the experimental results, and they showed that using the RSM-Desirability approach, at the optimum level of parameters, the percentage errors for Ra, Kt, and Max. DLL have been less than 6.312%, 7.229%, and 6.78%, respectively. As per the results Ra, Kt and Max. DLL improves by 12.6%, 14.4% and 73.6% respectively by using RSM-Desirability approach as compared to TM-GRA. The microscopic features of optimally machined surfaces are investigated using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature 2023.",

      "Abstract": "Biomarkers are specific indicators that can be used to authenticate vegetable oils by reflecting unique characteristics such as variety or geographical origin. Biomarkers can originate from the primary components of the vegetable oil itself or from contaminants and trace substances linked to processing methods or adulterants. The review highlights the key findings in the identification of novel biomarkers for vegetable oil authentication. Various analytical techniques have proven effective in distinguishing unique biomarkers associated with specific vegetable oil varieties or geographical origins. The use of biomarkers of vegetable oils and associated contaminants or trace substances offers a comprehensive approach to authentication. However, the identification of novel biomarkers holds immense potential for enhancing food safety, preventing fraud, and safeguarding consumer health in the vegetable oil industry. The ongoing research and advancements in biomarker identification represent a promising avenue for addressing authenticity concerns in vegetable oils. © 2024 The Authors",

      "Abstract": "Most of the motorized two wheelers move in the city traffic where they face congestion and large idle times with engine-on condition. This leads to wastage of fuel and unnecessary environment pollution because of emissions. Stringent emission norms and an awkwardness towards the environment has made auto manufacturers develop systems that can reduce fuel loss during idling and further reduce emissions. Vehicle owners are taking care of this by turning off the engine at traffic lights. This manual operation needs automation with stop/start facility thus reducing drivers' intervention. The present work aims to analyze a two-wheeler engine start and stop system for efficient fuel utilization by two wheelers on Indian roads. The designed system is fitted on a 100 cc four-stoke two wheeler. The sensor fitted senses the motion of the wheel; once the wheel is idle for 5 seconds it stops the engine, restarting takes place once the accelerator pedal and gear operation is sensed. When the system was tested on the retrofitted two wheeler it was observed that 0.021 liter/h of fuel is saved during idling because of this application. Results further indicated that if this system is applied in 50% of vehicles running on Indian roads then for one hour per day of vehicle running, the saving will be 22.05 lakh liters of fuel per day. The net saving of fuel is 4.2% when this system is used on the motorized two wheeler for one hour of driving. The retrofitting of the system can be done on existing vehicles. Also, the developed system can be easily deployed in the existing production lines. This feature will thus not only contribute in fuel saving but will also help in improving the air quality by reducing fuel emission of the country. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Ajay Kumar, D.

      "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to re-examine the relationship between financial accessibility and performance of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in developing countries using a large database. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses cross-sectional firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprises Survey database collected under Wave II from 2006 to 2019. Controlled for firm level and country level factors, OLS and instrumental variable regressions have been used for analysis. Firm performance has been measured in terms of labour productivity. Findings: The study observes a positive association between access to finance and MSME performance measured in terms of sales and value-added per worker. Along with firm characteristics (like size, age and managerial experience), country’s development level, institutional quality (i.e. corruption and regulations) and economic openness also impact MSMEs’ productivity. Practical implications: Strengthening the financial system to allow the financial sector to meet the requirements of MSME finance is very important. Better access to external finance will enable MSMEs to invest in upgrading technology and expanding operations, thus improves their labour productivity. As the MSME sector is vulnerable to economic shocks, policies facilitating their access to formal credit during crises could strengthen resilience. Social implications: Credit constraint to MSMEs is a multi-stakeholder problem. It requires a coordinated approach from MSME owners, financial institutions and policymakers to address it and enhance the credit flow to the MSME sector. Timely research inputs from academia, research institutions and think tanks may help assess MSMEs promotion policies and their revision if needed. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that examines the effect of access to finance on the labour productivity of MSMEs in developing countries. Given the mixed results in the recent past between access to finance and firm performance, it highlights the critical role of financial accessibility in improving their labour productivity and thus enabling MSMEs to realise their full potential in developing countries. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

      "Abstract": "Existing measures of cultural orientations at the organizational level rely heavily on Hofstede's national cultural dimension scores, which overlook individual variability within countries. The Individual Cultural Values Scale (CVSCALE) measures individual orientations directly. This study aimed to investigate the factor structure and reliability of the CVSCALE for use with Indian corporate leaders. Data was collected from 321 Indian organizational leaders using the 26-item CVSCALE. Factor structure and psychometric properties were examined through exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis. A five-factor structure consistent with CVSCALE dimensions emerged. Reliability coefficients exceeded acceptable thresholds (α = 0.901; split-half = 0.794). Dimension scores ranged from low to high, contrasting some of Hofstede's national Indian scores. Results support the CVSCALE as a reliable, valid tool for directly assessing cultural orientations at the individual level within Indian organizations. While uncertainty avoidance was high, other dimensions varied individually. This highlights that culture is complex, with diversity existing below the national level. The CVSCALE enables rich cultural analysis beyond solely examining nationality. © 2024, Creative Publishing House. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "The software industry is evolving at a rapid pace, making it necessary to optimize efforts and accelerate the software development process. Software can be reused to achieve quality and productivity goals. Reusability is a crucial measure that can be used to increase the overall level of software quality in less time and effort. To better understand the necessity of enhancing the software reusability of Object- Oriented (O-O) systems, this study employed a semi-automated approach to measure the values of classlevel software metrics on an input dataset collected from the MAVEN repository. This paper explored several previous studies, data strategies, and tools to predict reusability in O-O software systems. This study compares various data mining techniques to identify the most suitable approach for enhancing the reusability of O-O software systems. The analysis was based on performance parameters such as precision, MSE, and accuracy rates. Due to its higher precision and lower MSE, the SOM technique is considered one of the top data mining approaches to increase the reusability of O-O software systems. However, the results show that the different levels of reusability in O-O software systems are not adequately addressed in current solutions © by the authors.",

      "Abstract": "This investigation delves into the behavior of copper oxide (CuO) as a solid lubricant inside zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) ceramic composites. The investigation starts with the preparation of ZTA through co-precipitation followed by powder metallurgy to develop CuO (1.5 wt. %)/ZTA composites. In all cases, hot isotactic pressing is applied for densification. The fully densified samples are thoroughly mirror-polished to investigate the mechanical and tribological properties. A 1.8% reduction in micro-hardness and 6% improvement in fracture toughness are observed with incorporation of CuO into the ZTA matrices. The analysis reveals that the presence of ionic copper at the grain boundary leads to the formation of copper-rich phases, causing a decrease in hardness. However, the softer CuO particles contribute to crack bridging and crack deflection, enhancing fracture toughness. Subsequent investigation into the tribological properties highlights the positive influence of the softer CuO phases acting as a secondary component within the ZTA matrix. A significant enhancement of 39.34% in the Coefficient of Friction (COF) is achieved by incorporating CuO into the ZTA matrix. This improvement can be attributed to the formation of a patchy layer through smearing and squeezing actions on wear debris during sliding. The uniform patchy layer results in smoother and more polished surfaces, leading to an improvement in both the COF and specific wear rate. Further wear analysis reveals various phenomena contributing to surface wear, including pullout of grain particles, micro-fracture, high abrasions, and laminar removal of grains. Overall, the introduction of CuO proves to be beneficial, showcasing improved mechanical and tribological properties in the developed composites, with application in dies, inserts, sparkplugs, etc. © 2024 Author(s).",

      "Abstract": "The role of the plant innate immune system in the defense and symbiosis processes becomes integral in a complex network of interactions between plants and fungi. An understanding of the molecular characterization of the plant innate immune system is crucial because it constitutes plants’ self-defense shield against harmful fungi, while creating mutualistic relationships with beneficial fungi. Due to the plant-induced awareness and their complexity of interaction with fungi, sufficient assessment of the participation of the plant innate immune system in ecological balance, agriculture, and maintenance of an infinite ecosystem is mandatory. Given the current global challenge, such as the surge of plant-infectious diseases, and pursuit of sustainable forms of agriculture; it is imperative to understand the molecular language of communication between plants and fungi. That knowledge can be practically used in diverse areas, e.g., in agriculture, new tactics may be sought after to try new methods that boost crop receptiveness against fungal pathogens and reduce the dependence on chemical management. Also, it could boost sustainable agricultural practices via enhancing mycorrhizal interactions that promote nutrient absorption and optimum cropping with limited exposure of environmental contamination. Moreover, this review offers insights that go beyond agriculture and can be manipulated to boost plant conservation, environmental restoration, and quality understanding of host-pathogen interactions. Consequently, this specific review paper has offered a comprehensive view of the complex plant innate immune-based responses with fungi and the mechanisms in which they interact. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH",

      "Abstract": "This chapter investigates the intricate relationship between basic scientific discoveries and their integration into successful or unsuccessful commercial ventures. Through a comparative analysis of Genentech and Theranos, this study aims to identify the factors influencing the success and failure of integration of scientific innovation into commercial aspects. Using reviews of literature and previously published reports, this study explores the dynamics of converting scientific innovation into commercial products. The study presents the comparison of two such scientific innovations where one was successful commercially and the other was a failure. The case taken to present successful integration is Genentech's recombinant human insulin and the case taken to present failure is Therano's blood testing technology. The finding of the study presents the factors responsible for success and failure of two. This comparative analysis provides valuable insights for researchers, scientists, academicians, professionals, etc., facilitating them to make strategic planning. © 2024, IGI Global.

      "Abstract": "This research investigates the integration of vision-based navigation into the charging procedure of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs). The study offers a comprehensive examination of the precision of calibration, the ability to identify objects, the navigation capabilities of autonomous cars, and the effectiveness of charging sessions. The visual systems undergo meticulous calibration, which leads to inherent traits that are crucial for accurate perception. Object recognition algorithms have exceptional proficiency in precisely spotting electric vehicles, charging stations, cables, and obstacles, while also exhibiting heightened levels of confidence. The adaptive navigation framework exhibits improved precision, as seen by developments in velocity and steering angle, enabling AEVs to effectively navigate through complex urban scenarios. Examining the data from charging sessions indicates that the integration of vision- based navigation has led to enhanced operational effectiveness of AEVs. This is apparent via the significant reduction in charging duration and the favorable boost in energy output. The cross-parameter analysis reveals the interconnectedness, emphasizing the influence of accurate calibration on the recognition and movement of objects. It showcases a holistic integration of perception, navigation, and charging procedures. The findings have significant implications for the widespread adoption of vision-based navigation, providing a groundbreaking method for seamlessly incorporating autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) into real-world scenarios. Future research should give priority to enhancing calibration techniques, exploring advanced object detection algorithms, and resolving challenges related to dynamic urban environments. This will serve to validate the agility and reliability of the vision-based navigation architecture. In summary, this research offers valuable insights into the potential impact of vision-based navigation on the process of charging autonomous electric vehicles. Vision-based navigation is essential for the successful operation of AEVs in dynamic urban contexts. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",

      "Abstract": "Objectives: This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of turmeric, ashwagandha, and aloe vera in the management of oral lichen planus (OLP) lesion. Materials and Methods: Thirty patients with histologically confirmed symptomatic OLP with gingival presentation were included in this comparative investigation. Three groups of participants were created: Group I consisted of turmeric; group II included ashwagandha; and group III included aloe vera. For 3 weeks in a row, they were told to apply topical treatments twice a day. The patients were recalled for 4 to evaluate the cessation of symptoms. Result: The participants in all the groups showed a considerable improvement in the burning lesion size and pain after 4 months of follow-up. Conclusion: For the treatment of OLP, turmeric, ashwagandha, and aloe vera can be useful as substitute topical medications, particularly for those who are not responsive to topical corticosteroids. © 2024 Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences.",

      "Abstract": "Since the earliest days, people have been employing herbal treatments extensively around the world. The development of phytochemical and phytopharmacological sciences has made it possible to understand the chemical composition and biological properties of a number of medicinal plant products. Due to certain challenges like large molecular weight and low bioavailability, some components of herbal extracts are not utilized for therapeutic purposes. It has been suggested that herbal medicine and nanotechnology can be combined to enhance the benefits of plant extracts by lowering dosage requirements and adverse effects and increasing therapeutic activity. Using nanotechnology, the active ingredient can be delivered in an adequate concentration and transported to the targeted site of action. Conventional therapy does not fulfill these requirements. This review focuses on different skin diseases and nanotechnology-based herbal medicines that have been utilized to treat them. © 2024 by the authors.",

      "Abstract": "The pandemic has brought attention to the importance of a healthy immune system in preventing infectious diseases. In this in-depth review, the process by which nutritional interventions and fundamental nutrients affect immune function has been discussed with the goal of enhancing the body's natural defenses against viral infections. We explored the complex interplay between diet and immunology, highlighting the essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and bioactive substances that are crucial for enhancing immune response. We also investigated the effect of dietary patterns and supplementation methods on immune function. We assessed the effectiveness and potential mechanisms of action of various nutritional therapies in modifying immune responses through a thorough examination of scientific literature. Additionally, we go through the significance of individualized nutrition and highlight possible factors to consider for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and people with chronic conditions. This review attempts to provide a thorough understanding of the role of diet in boosting immunity by synthesizing available research. It also offers insights into practical methods for enhancing the immune function during the current epidemic and in the future. © 2024 The Authors.

      "Abstract": "An efficient revocation of access rights in ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CPABE) schemes has multiple challenges, particularly for lightweight devices. Thus, extensive research on the existing studies enforcing and governing access control has been conducted. The methodologies used in the existing CPABE (bilinear pairing cryptography based) schemes to revoke users at the system and attribute levels have been focused on in the current study. The existing studies have been examined on the basis of the following parameters for revocation: type of revocation addressed, level of collusion resistance, dynamicity achieved, scalability of revocation, and computational cost incurred. It has been observed in the study that no single scheme achieves all the revocation properties and addresses both types of revocation. The module proposed in proxy-based and collusion-resistant multi-authority revocable CPABE (PCMR-CPABE) efficiently addresses both types of revocation and is fully collusion-resistant, dynamic, and scalable. The present paper extends the study on PCMR-CPABE and presents a performance analysis of the module in terms of functional specifications and computational cost. The presented analysis has compared the performance of the existing cutting-edge schemes with the PCMR-CPABE module and has proved that the proposed module is better in terms of functionality and is computationally inexpensive. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

      "Abstract": "Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique successfully used to classify and retrieve textual data. However, the performance of topic models is sensitive to selecting optimal hyperparameters, the number of topics 'K' and Dirichlet priors 'α' and 'β.' This data-driven analysis aims to determine the optimum number of topics, 'K,' within the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. This work utilizes three datasets, namely 20-Newsgroups news articles, Wikipedia articles, and Web of Science containing science articles, to assess and compare various 'K' values through the grid search approach. The grid search approach finds the best combination of hyperparameter values by trying all possible combinations to see which performs best. This research seeks to identify the 'K' that optimizes topic relevance, coherence, and model performance by leveraging statistical metrics, such as coherence scores, perplexity, and topic distribution quality. Through empirical analysis and rigorous evaluation, this work provides valuable insights for determining the ideal 'K' for LDA models. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

      "Abstract": "Background: Computer professionals often develop a forward head posture due to prolonged hours of computer use, leading to neck pain. Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM), an advanced technique for treating myofascial trigger points, has become increasingly popular for addressing these musculoskeletal issues. Objectives: The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of IASTM mobilization on SBAL (superficial back arm line) and SM(specific muscles-upper trapezius, levator scapulae, and sternocleidomastoid) in managing chronic neck pain among computer professionals. Participants & methods: The study involved 62 computer professionals, randomly divided into two groups. Group A received IASTM on SBAL and group B received IASTM on SM for neck pain each receiving three sessions weekly for four weeks. Outcome variables like Neck Disability Index (NDI), NPRS(Neck Pain Rating Scale), Craniovertebral angle (CVA), and range of motion (ROM) for flexion, and side flexion (right & left side) were evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks. Results: Significant improvement in NPRS were observed in both the SBAL and SM groups after 2 weeks of IASTM, wth the SBAL group demonstrating greater improvement. At 4 weeks, IASTM on SBAL showed significantly higher improvements in NPRS, CVA, NDI, and flexion compared to the SM group. The repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of both time and group, along with a significant interaction between time and group for all outcome variables, except for CVA. Conclusion: The study indicates that IASTM on SBAL may offer a more effective treatment for chronic neck pain in computer professionals compared to targeting specific muscles. © 2024",

      "Abstract": "The unsatisfactory performance of public sector made the Government introduce Memorandum of understanding and disinvestment. This study has been undertaken to analyze the performance of memorandum of understanding signed firms over the years. In addition, the performance of MoU-signed disinvested and MoU-signed non-disinvested firms have also been examined. Performance has been analysed using different ratios; return on equity, return on assets, net income productivity per employee and sales productivity per employee. In-line to analyze the effectiveness of data, random effect panel regression has been used to study the performance of sixty MoU signed PSEs for 15 years (2004-2018). The results indicate that the profitability of MoU signed non-disinvested firms is better than MoU signed disinvested firms. This could be possibly due to the more substantial managerial autonomy impact on the performance. Assets turnover ratio, leverage, and age have a significant effect on the performance of firms. © 2024, Corvinus University of Budapest. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "Introduction: COVID-19 has been the subject of a number of inquiries recently. All country's capital market practices have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Economic woes, along with the stock market crash, have hit emerging markets and developing economies in a variety of directions. Purpose: This study is an attempt to focus on the Indian economy to provide the gist of the situation and recovery mode of an economy with the help of growth indicators of the economy. Methodology: This study is based on secondary data. The researchers applied some econometric tools, viz, unit root test Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Panel Granger Causality, and Panel ARDL Bound Test were applied to examine the relationship of economic indicators and stock market benchmark in two periods: March 2020-June 2021 (during period) and July 2021 to March 2022 (post period). Findings: The findings of this study explored the different causal relationships for the selected variables in both periods. The study discussed the reasons for ARDL (Auto Regressive Distributed Lag) bound for all selected factors. The study revealed the story of crude oil prices and Gold as trusted investment avenues during the crises. Significance/Value: As we know, the capital market's backlash is reflected in movements in stock prices and stock exchange volume, which are concerned with the economic effects of the pandemic and urged the segment to react. Investors can use the information in the event to make investment decisions. © 2024 Kirti Khanna, Vikas Sharma and Munish Gupta. Published under exclusive licence by Emerald Publishing Limited.

      "Abstract": "As a decentralised platform, blockchain may be used by educational organisations to exchange details about online courses and programmes, as well as by students to rate what is offered online. This will aid in the discovery of accredited programmes that will help other students enhance their education. The management of academic records as well as how students and teachers collaborate have the potential to be significantly changed by blockchain. Blockchain's distributed ledger technology can significantly improve the transparency and accountability of the education sector. Numerous aspects of education could be impacted by blockchain, including keeping student information, awarding certifications and diplomas, storing papers, and developing curriculum and courses. Smart contracts can be used to create exam papers, and blockchain-enabled technology can be applied to evaluation as well. In the Gartner study, approximately 50% of respondents from the higher education sector expressed a lack of interest in using blockchain. This opposition may be mostly attributed to the challenges of technological integration, such as worries about security, scalability, adoption rate, and cost. In this chapter, the function of blockchain in the educational space is examined, along with all of its applications and difficulties. © 2024 Bentham Science Publishers. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "Stacked Nano-sheets FinFET device has evolved as a viable alternative to FinFET in designing low power circuits. The performance analysis of the novel Quad Gate Stacked Nano-sheets (QG-SNS) FinFET device and its comparison with FinFET and Stacked Nano-sheets devices have been carried out. QG-SNS FinFET device is designed on Cogenda TCAD tool at 30 nm technology node. Device simulation results indicate a steep sub-threshold slope of 26.7 mV/decade, ON current of is 1.0×10−5 A, and OFF current of is 9.85×10−14 A. The maximum cutoff frequency of 381 GHz is reported. The designed device shows higher early voltage and better device efficiency. Further, the performance-based comparative analysis of common source amplifier circuit designed with QG-SNS FinFET device is done with FinFET based amplifier. Circuit simulations have been performed utilizing the Look up table based Verilog-A model. Amplification of factor 1.93 has been achieved by QG-SNS FinFET based amplifier which is 60.8% better than that achieved by FinFET based amplifier, highlighting the capability of QG-SNS FinFET device for high frequency circuits having input signals of frequency 100 MHz. Average power dissipation and leakage power are reduced by 1.12 and 10−6 times respectively in QG-SNS FinFET based amplifier. © The Author(s) 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Road traffic and congestion control have always been an issue on Indian roads. Besides this, the burning of fossil fuels, environmental harm, and related problems are always there. To avoid this, aerial vehicles (drones) are among the best options to adopt and reduce road traffic. This paper aims to study and review the technologies for an aerial vehicle that can lift a human, i.e., a human-driven drone. Countries like the USA and China are already using big and small drones for delivery, surveillance, medical support, etc. This paper will try to upgrade the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system to a Manned Aerial Vehicle (MAV). The results reveal that ten 150kV outrunners BLDC motor propulsion systems (decacopter) with 12s Li-Po batteries with a 15C continuous discharge rate, 275A ESCs, and 32 x11.5inches, carbon fiber propeller blades can lift the aircraft aloft with a human weighing up to 90kg. © 2024 Joint Journal of Novel Carbon Resource Sciences and Green Asia Strategy.

      "Abstract": "Black carrots are an essential component of the human diet due to the presence of various beneficial nutrients, including polyphenols, anthocyanins, and phenolic acids. Black carrots can be added to enhance the color, taste, and nutritional value of a number of food products. Black carrots provide several health advantages, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer characteristics. Black carrots lose some of their antioxidant power during extraction and during the storage period. The most prevalent anthocyanin in black carrot is cyanidin-3-xylosyl-feruloyl-glucosyl-galactoside. It is critical to consider the stability of anthocyanins while working with black carrot extracts. Anthocyanin stability may alter in response to environmental conditions like heat, light, pH, and oxygen. Anthocyanins may undergo photochemical breakdown when exposed to light, and thermal breakdown when exposed to high temperatures. The pH may also affect the stability of anthocyanins, with a low pH leading to colorless and reduced stability. This review discusses the storage stability of bioactive components in black carrots. This study discusses the various polyphenols present in black carrots and their potential advantages, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, and anti-hypersensitivity actions. The numerous pharmacological functions of the flavonoids found in black carrots, including quercetin, luteolin, and myricetin are discussed. © 2024",

Multiple parameters, including extract yield, total phenol, total flavonoid, antioxidant activity, and chlorophyll content were used to optimize the conditions. The linear relationship between power intensity and responses was determined to be statistically significant, with a p-value less than 0.01. The interaction effect of temperature, time, and ratio of solid solvent was shown to be statistically significant (p < 0.05) for all the obtained results. The optimal parameters for achieving the highest extract yield were as follows: a temperature of 40 °C, a sonication time of 30 min, and a solid solvent ratio of 1:10. These conditions result in an extract yield of 21.99 %, a total flavonoid content of 44.97 mg/GAE, a total phenolic content of 185.05 mg/GAE, a DPPH scavenging activity of 99.1 %, and a chlorophyll content of 49.95 mg/ml. This study highlights the significance of customized extraction methodologies for optimizing the bioactive capacity of phytochemicals derived from betel leaves. The elucidation of extraction parameters and the resultant phytochemical profiles serves as a fundamental framework for the advancement of innovative pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, capitalizing on the therapeutic attributes of this traditional medicinal botanical. © 2024",

      "Abstract": "The prevalence of skin illnesses is higher than that of other diseases. Fungal infection, bacteria, allergies, viruses, genetic factors, and environmental factors are among important causative factors that have continuously escalated the degree and incidence of skin diseases. Medical technology based on lasers and photonics has made it possible to identify skin illnesses considerably more rapidly and correctly. However, the cost of such a diagnosis is currently limited and prohibitively high and restricted to developed areas. The present paper develops a holistic, critical, and important skin disease prediction system that utilizes machine learning and deep learning algorithms to accurately identify up to 20 different skin diseases with a high F1 score and efficiency. Deep learning algorithms like Xception, Inception-v3, Resnet50, DenseNet121, and Inception-ResNet-v2 were employed to accurately classify diseases based on the images. The training and testing have been performed on an enlarged dataset, and classification was performed for 20 diseases. The algorithm developed was free from any inherent bias and treated all classes equally. The present model, which was trained using the Xception algorithm, is highly efficient and accurate for 20 different skin conditions, with a dataset of over 10,000 photos. The developed system was able to classify 20 different dermatological diseases with high accuracy and precision. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland 2023.",

      "Abstract": "Background: Diabetes and related peripheral neuropathy result in various sensory and motor complications. Such changes are documented early and more precisely in nerve conduction studies than in clinical evaluation and quantitative sensory testing. Different exercises and mobilization also affect the same differently. Objective: This review aimed to compile the current evidence on the effectiveness of exercises and manual therapy on nerve conduction studies of lower limbs in patients with diabetes and diabetic peripheral neuropathy and to evaluate the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Studies that examined the effects of different exercises and manual therapy on nerve conduction studies of lower limbs in patients with diabetes mellitus and diabetic peripheral neuropathy were searched on available databases. The PRISMA statement was followed. Quality check was done using the Pedro scale. Results: Thirteen studies matched the inclusion criteria. Interventions included moderate-intensity aerobic exercises, resistance exercises, tai chi exercises, sensorimotor and gait training, neurodynamic mobilization, and a combination of aerobics and resistance training. Conclusion: The present systematic review suggests that 8 to 12 weeks of physical exercise improves nerve conduction velocity of the motor tibial, peroneal nerve, and sensory sural nerve in diabetes with or without peripheral neuropathy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India 2023.",

      "Abstract": "Earthquakes are enormous natural disasters that increase the energy within the structural system, causing catastrophic destruction. Various control systems, such as passive, active, hybrid, and semi active control systems, can be used to dissipate this unwanted energy. The fluid viscous damper is one such dissipation device used in this study. The goal of this project is to use a fluid viscous damper to lessen the seismic response of the Symmetrical and unsymmetrical G+9 structure in ETABS2017. To obtain the seismic response with and without a fluid viscous damper, ETABS2017 was used to analyse symmetrical and unsymmetrical structures with and without a fluid viscous damper. The analysis takes into account nonlinear temporal history, which is derived using fast nonlinear analysis of Electro data. The position and function of dampers are discussed in this study. For seismic evaluation of buildings with and without fluid viscous dampers, the equivalent static approach and response spectrum method are utilised. The structure was examined utilizing ETABs 2017 programming, with seismic zone IV and medium soil (Type II) according to IS 1893-2016. The structure's exhibition is assessed utilizing story removal, story shear, story float, and modular periods and frequencies. The objective of this study is to about the consequences of static and reaction range examination in both longitudinal and cross over bearings for damper development with and without damper structure. © 2024 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",

      "Abstract": "The purpose of this initial study was to look at the connections between gestational weight increase and the mother's and fetus's outcomes in the first trimester of pregnancy and their link to each other. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at two tertiary care hospitals with pregnant women enrolled during the first trimester. Information was gathered from self-reported questionnaires and electronic health records on maternal BMI, gestational weight gain, and maternal and foetal outcomes. Multiple logistic regression models were used to evaluate relationships between maternal BMI, gestational weight increase, and pregnancy outcomes. There were 500 participants in the study. An increased risk of hypertensive diseases, gestational Diabetes, and caesarean section deliveries has been linked to higher maternal BMI. A higher risk of macrosomia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and preterm birth were associated with lower maternal BMI. A higher incidence of gestational Diabetes and hypertensive diseases was linked to gestational weight growth that was below the advised range. On the other hand, rapid weight increase was associated with an increased risk of macrosomia, IUGR, and premature birth. Combined research showed that the greatest risk of gestational Diabetes and hypertensive problems was associated with obese women who gained weight over what was indicated. In summary, comprehending the intricate connections among maternal body mass index, gestational weight increase, and pregnancy consequences is essential for enhancing prenatal care and mitigating the hazards linked to maternal obesity and unwarranted weight growth. More study is required to understand the underlying mechanisms further and create evidence-based methods for improving the health of both the mother and the foetus. © 2024, IGI Global.",

      "Abstract": "Gingival enlargement is a side effect of several different medication, including immunosuppressants, anticonvulsants, and calcium channel blockers. It is an inflammatory response that starts when plaque and calculus build up on the tooth surface. The most prevalent long-term neurological condition affecting people is epilepsy. In affluent nations, the prevalence of epilepsy is ∼ 1%, whereas in less developed countries, it may >2%. The preferred medication for the condition, phenytoin, has major side effects include gingival enlargement. In addition to being visually disfiguring, this enlargement frequently affects speech, chewing and eating. Furthermore, those with poor dental hygiene, causes disabilities with motor coordination and muscular limitations leading to mental disability and physical impairments are more prone to periodontal disease.

      "Abstract": "Purpose: Sport and digitization have something surprising in common: both are drivers of gender equality and women’s empowerment. In sports, performance is the end target for any Asian athlete. Performance is determined psychologically and physiologically Burgeoning research has shed light on the efficacy of digital devices such as smart watches, biofeedback which can help athletes in their athletic performance and general well-being thus empowering athletes in their progress. However, there has been a gap in identifying the impact of certain psychological variables on performance. Hence, the objective of the present research was to explore metacognition, grit, self-efficacy, and social support on performance among athletes. Design/methodology/approach: This study intends to fill the research gap by using a mixed method approach. The quantitative part of the section applied a cross-sectional survey design (n=201) for which correlation and regression analysis was used to answer the research questions. For the qualitative part of the study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the female sub-elite athletes (n=6). The interviews were transcribed and subjected to an interpretative phenomenological analysis. Findings: The findings of this research provide a nuanced perspective to the existing literature in understanding the performance facilitators which can help female athletes attain performance subsequently empowering them through their athletic ranking. Additionally, through the results of qualitative part, it has been found that digital devices such as smart watches, biofeedback, other sport science-based equipment have helped the sub-elite athletes to improve their performance. This suggests that amalgamation of both psychological and psychophysiological process can lead to enhanced athletic performance. Implications: Our suggested future directions focus on the development of targeted interventions and programs aimed at enhancing athletic performance through legitimate means, thereby amalgamating sports and technology for the ameliorating effects. © 2024 by authors, all rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "Spring waters originates from carbonate aquifers provides substantial water for drinking and widely used for irrigation in Afghanistan. Thus, understanding hydrogeochemical evolution in carbonate dominated aquifer is important for sustainable groundwater resource management in the country. Therefore, in this study, water from springs and dug wells from carbonate dominated aquifers were investigated to study hydrogeochemical evolution in Upper Shirin Tagab sub-basin, Northern Afghanistan. This study reveals that water in the area mainly belongs to Ca-Mg-HCO3 facies type in Upper part and Mg-(Na, Ca)-SO4-(HCO3, Cl) in the lower part. The hydrogeochemical processes in the aquifer were found to be governed by dissolution of carbonate, gypsum and halite minerals. Results shows that the chemical composition of springs is primarily controlled by local geology and water-rock interactions of limestone and dolomite with minor effects of silicate weathering. The δ2D-H2O and δ18O-H2O of springs water shows wide variations and found in the range of −64.4 ‰ to −52.6 ‰ and −10.1 ‰ to −8.6 ‰, respectively. Stable isotopes of water indicate that the water in the study area receive recharge from infiltration of recent precipitation and showing less evaporative enrichment of heavier isotopes. Overall, the quality of groundwater is safe for drinking with respect to WHO guidelines but the aquifer is suspectable to anthropogenic contamination such as sewage sludge, excessive nutrients, sulfate and pathogens. Furthermore, findings of this study will be helpful for decision makers to develop a sustainable water resource management in Shirin Tagab sub-basin in Northern Afghanistan. © 2024",

      "Abstract": "The use of neuroscience techniques in marketing is known as neuroscience marketing. This emerging marketing field uses medical technology to study how the brain reacts to stimuli related to marketing. In essence, neuroscience marketing is a technique that aids businesses in investigating consumer purchasing behavior. Marketers can explore why customers make their own decisions by measuring a consumer's preference based on activity in specific brain regions. The use of neuromarketing strategies in advertising and packaging design tactics is covered in this chapter, along with how they allow marketers to exert a pre-established emotional effect. © 2024, IGI Global.

      "Abstract": "This paper investigates the factors influencing Indian consumers' intentions to continue using online food delivery services. Utilising a sample of 205 respondents from the Delhi/NCR region, the study employs an exploratory-cum-descriptive research design. Initial analysis dropped two constructs, accuracy and economy, due to poor factor loadings while confirming the significance of convenience, speed, trust, customer satisfaction, and continuance intentions through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The findings highlight the importance of speed, convenience, and trust in enhancing customer satisfaction and retention. The study suggests that online food delivery providers should focus on these factors to ensure quality service and maintain customer loyalty. This research contributes to understanding consumer behaviour in the context of online food delivery services in India, offering insights for businesses aiming for long-term growth by enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. © 2024 Indian Society of Agricultural Economics.

      "Abstract": "The main aim of the present study was to conduct an in-depth investigation into the impact of \"talent management practices\" and \"employee retention\" in private sector banks in the Jaipur area. In addition, the study aimed to explore the potential of job satisfaction as a mediator for improving the relationship between the two variables above. To achieve these objectives, a structured questionnaire was distributed to a research sample of 200 employees who were randomly selected from six private sector banks in the Jaipur circle. A quantitative research method was used for data collection, and the research instrument consisted of a self-administered questionnaire. The convenience sampling technique was used to select the research participants. The proposed hypotheses were evaluated using a structural equation model. The study's results revealed a strong and significant positive relationship between talent management practices in banks and staff retention. Furthermore, the study found that job satisfaction played a crucial role in mediating this relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Overall, the study employed a well-fitted model to clarify the relationship between talent management practices and employee retention in private-sector banks. The findings of this research could be valuable for banks in the Jaipur area and other organizations in the financial industry that are interested in enhancing their talent management practices and retaining their valuable employees. © 2024, Iquz Galaxy Publisher.

      "Abstract": "This research aims to develop a framework for software fault prediction (SFP) using machine learning techniques. A software fault may be the reason behind the failure of software functioning, and even a minor fault could cause the failure. Efficient SFP improves the overall quality and performance of the software products while streamlining the development process. The framework aims to reduce the cost and time involved in software development while optimizing the reliability of the software. It facilitates quick and efficient testing by identifying the modules that are likely to fail at the early stages of the project. Soft computing techniques provide an easy and effective solution for prediction problems. This study emphasizes the significance of soft computing approaches in SFP and highlights their role in improving computational efficiency, reducing development costs, and enhancing the reliability of software applications. Soft computing-based technique was proposed to address the prediction challenges. A metric suite was suggested, which includes a requirement-based metric and an adoption metric, designed by integrating process metrics of software development phases for fault prediction. It also designs decision tree regression (DTR)-based SFP model that uses these metrics as input and delivers predicted faults as output. The literature review reveals that only a few existing frameworks meet the requirement of implementing SFP models using a broad range of soft computing approaches for the same dataset. The suggested metric suite is validated by computing performance measures such as the area under curve (AUC), F-measure, precision, recall, and accuracy. The high-performance values of the suggested metric suite demonstrate its efficient fault prediction capability. The study also compares the performance of the suggested model with other adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), fuzzy-inference systems, and Bayesian-net-based SFP models, measured by root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), the mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE), the balanced mean magnitude of relative error (BMMRE), and R-Squared. The suggested model outperforms others, achieving RMSE, MMRE, and R-Squared values of 3.54, 2.04 e-05, and 99.78, respectively. This study presents a highly efficient DTR based SFP model with more fault prediction accuracy than the existing SFP models. Implementation of this model is to significantly reduce costs and improve the time and effort of software development, making it an invaluable tool for software engineers. © 2024 Gurmeet Kaur et al.",

      "Abstract": "Background: Dietary intake is an important factor in the development and management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) however, optimal food group composition remains unclear. Data on detailed food group intake of NAFLD patients from India is scarce. Methods & Materials: In this study with 320 participants (160 NAFLD cases and 160 controls), dietary habits were assessed using a 24-h dietary recall for two days and a validated 142-item food frequency questionnaire over the past year. Principal component analysis identified dietary patterns associated with NAFLD among the participants. Results: Cases were having a significantly higher intake of edible oils and fats along with nuts and oilseeds as compared to controls (p < 0.05). There was a positive and significant association with edible oils and fats with NAFLD [OR (95 % CI):1.7 (1.11–2.49) p = 0.013). In dietary pattern analysis western dietary pattern was found to be a risk for NAFLD whereas protective dietary pattern was associated with the decreased risk of NAFLD. Conclusion: The overall food groups intake in NAFLD cases and controls was low suggesting lower diet quality. Protective dietary pattern found to be beneficial for NAFLD. High intake of sugars and edible oils associated with western dietary pattern increases the risk of NAFLD. © 2024",

      "Abstract": "Objectives: The knowledge and awareness surrounding dental implants have significantly increased over the years, driven by advancements in technology, improved educational resources, and increased accessibility to dental care. Despite their widespread use, it is essential to assess the level of knowledge and awareness among patients regarding dental implants. The purpose of the present study is to measure the knowledge, awareness and decision making in dental implant therapy in North Indian population. Settings and design: An analytical closed ended questionnaire based study. Methods: A cross-sectional well structured questionnaire survey was conducted amongst 300 out patients randomly either by interview or Google form to assess the knowledge and awareness about dental implant as a treatment modality. There were seven questions which were close ended multiple choice type concerning patient knowledge and 10 questions for assessing awareness and decision making towards dental implants. Date was collected and descriptive analysis was done. Results: 43.67 % of population was either well informed or moderately informed about replacement of missing teeth. For replacement of missing tooth, most of them (83 %) had the knowledge of dental implant therapy. Dentist was the main source of information about implants. 90.67 % studied population believed that implants provide better treatment because of increased chewing efficiency of implants as compared to removable partial dentures or fixed partial dentures. 86.67 % patients thought that implantologist is better qualified that general dental surgeon. 94 % patients were keen to know more about implants. There is non-significant difference in knowledge and awareness as well as decision making for males and females (p<0.05). Conclusion: People have partial knowledge about dental implants and there is need of spreading awareness about implant therapy in the region. Dentist plays a crucial role for dissemination of knowledge. Cost is a constraining factor for this implant therapy to be chosen as a treatment modality. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

      "Abstract": "The chapter focuses on the phenomena of digital currencies issued by central banks (CBDC). The approach to the cashless economy, the battle against money laundering and tax evasion, the growing competition of private digital currencies, the enhancement of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, and the technological advancement of the payment sector were identified as important factors contributing to the development of digital currencies by central banks. Availability, anonymity, P2P transfers, interest-bearing features, and other potential restrictions were examined and highlighted as major distinctions between CBDC and private digital currencies and physical currencies. The stability and dependability, safety, speed, and ease of use of the CBDC were highlighted as its primary benefits. The study applied TAM to explore the adoption pattern of digital currency by retail customers through selected banks. The findings explained how different factors are important in determining behavioral intention and CBDC use behavior. © 2024, IGI Global.",

      "Abstract": "Distributed systems have become a tremendous technological force that could revolutionize company operations while advancing ethics and boosting governance. Distributed systems can enable new business models, lower costs, and boost efficiency by utilizing the advantages of decentralization, transparency, and security. Organizations can further ensure that the advantages of distributed systems are exploited in a responsible and long-lasting manner by putting ethical and governance procedures in place. The main ideas and uses of distributed systems in corporate development, ethics, and governance are summarized in this review chapter. It defines distributed systems, examines their key characteristics, and discusses the benefits of using these systems in business development. The chapter also explores the relevance of ethics to business development and governance and examines the role of distributed systems in promoting ethical practices. Moreover, the chapter defines governance in distributed systems and discusses its importance, benefits, and examples of mechanisms that can be used. The review chapter also explores the challenges and limitations associated with implementing distributed systems in business development, ethics, and governance. Technical complexity, scalability, interoperability, regulatory challenges, and governance challenges are all significant concerns that must be carefully considered and addressed. Organizations can choose the best way to use distributed systems to boost governance, encourage ethics, and drive growth by being aware of these obstacles and constraints. In conclusion, the adoption of distributed systems has the potential to fundamentally alter how companies are created, run, and governed, while simultaneously encouraging moral behavior and raising participant confidence. Organizations can decide how to best use these systems to spur growth, advance ethics, and improve governance in a fast-changing world by knowing their advantages, drawbacks, and limitations. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

      "Abstract": "The specialization of entrepreneurship in MBA has been a topic of debate - if it is important, or if entrepreneurs would build up a certain set of beneficial skills. Or is it a waste of money and time? The investigators investigated the perception of students and tried to bridge the gap between what they expect from management education and what avenues are available in market. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the attitude of management students towards their career as entrepreneur and entrepreneurship, and the contribution of university entrepreneurship development program. Through survey, it was found that most of the students want to open up their own ventures and want to become their own boss. It was revealed from the results that family support and family background are the most deciding factor in choosing entrepreneurship in their management degree. The results also reveal that personal qualities of a person also play a very important role in bearing risk and starting their own startup. © 2024, IGI Global. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "Background: Effective irrigation is crucial for successful endodontic treatment. Traditional irrigants like sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) have been widely used, but there is a growing interest in exploring natural alternatives for their potential antimicrobial properties. Objective: The study aims to compare the antimicrobial efficacy of Neem, Bitter Gourd, and NaOCl, with and without ultrasonic activation in managing primary endodontic infections. Materials and Methods: Ninety patients were randomly assigned six groups (n = 15) Group 1: NaOCl, Group 2: NaOCl with passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI), Group 3: Neem juice, Group 4: Neem juice with PUI, Group 5: Bitter gourd juice, and Group 6: Bitter gourd juice with PUI. Bacteriological samples were collected before (S1) and after (S2) shaping, plated on brain heart infusion agar, and colony counting was done after 24 h. Statistical Analysis Used: Shapiro–Wilk test, one‑way ANOVA, post hoc Tukey analysis, and paired t‑test. Results: All the groups demonstrated a significant reduction in bacterial count. Groups with PUI (2, 4, 6) demonstrated higher mean bacterial reduction than their counterparts without PUI (1, 3, 5). Conclusion: Neem and Bitter gourd juices, particularly when used with PUI, demonstrated antimicrobial efficacy comparable to NaOCl with PUI. © 2024 Journal of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",

      "Abstract": "Sentiment analysis, a subfield of natural language processing (NLP), has grown significantly in importance and complexity. This research introduces an innovative framework for handling binary clustered sentences, a prevalent challenge in sentiment analysis. This approach groups sentences into positive or negative clusters and determines the sentiment of each cluster based on the majority of sentences within it, enhancing the overall accuracy of sentiment analysis. Another overlooked yet crucial aspect, the impact of negation and double negation on sentiment polarity, is also addressed. Current models often fail to capture these linguistic nuances, hindering a complete understanding of the true sentiment in the text. The research also introduces the FFBC algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex linguistic constructs like negations and double negations, often overlooked in current models. Validated on IMDb and Amazon Reviews Datasets, and tested on a unique Farmers' Protest Twitter dataset, the framework shows enhanced performance across key metrics compared to leading techniques like BERT, LSTMs, VADER, and SVM. This improvement underscores the potential of advanced sentiment analysis techniques in the digital era, offering significant insights into public sentiment during global events. The study concludes by highlighting the implications of this research for various stakeholders and outlining future research directions. © 2024 Joint Journal of Novel Carbon Resource Sciences and Green Asia Strategy.

      "Abstract": "Objective: Tramadol hydrochloride has shown local anesthetic properties similar to lidocaine, apart from a central analgesic effect. The present study evaluated the effect of the administration of tramadol alone or in addition to 2% lidocaine, as supplementary intraligamentary injections. Methods: One hundred and five patients, with a failed primary inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB), were randomly allocated to one of the three supplementary intraligamentary groups: 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine; tramadol hydrochloride (50 mg/mL); and 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine plus tramadol hydrochloride. Patients received 1.2 mL doses (0.6 mL of each root). Patients reporting pain ≤54 on Heft Parker visual analogue scale (Heft-Parker VAS), were categorized as successful anesthesia. A finger pulse oximeter was used to measure the heart rates. The anesthetic success rates, gender, and type of tooth were compared using the Pearson chi-square test. The heart rates and age were statistically evaluated using the one-way analysis of variance test. The level of significance was set at 0.05 (p=0.05). Results: The initial IANB was successful in 31% of cases. There were significant differences in the anesthetic success rates of different supplementary intraligamentary injections (χ2= 33.6, p&lt;0.001, df=2). The 2% lidocaine-plus-tramadol resulted in significantly higher success rates than the two groups. There were no significant changes in the baseline heart rates of all groups (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion: The addition of tramadol to 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine, given as supplementary intraligamentary injection, can help in achieving successful anesthesia during the endodontic management of mandibular molars with irreversible pulpitis resistant to IANB injections.

      "Abstract": "Background: Choline oxidase, a flavoprotein, is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction which converts choline into glycine betaine. Choline oxidase started its journey way back in 1933. However, the impact of the high temperature on its structure has not been explored despite the long history and availability of its crystal structure. Both choline oxidase and its product, glycine betaine, have enormous applications spanning across multiple industries. Understanding how the 3D structure of the enzyme will change with the temperature change can open new ways to make it more stable and useful for industry. Process: This research paper presents the in-silico study and analysis of the structural changes of A. globiformis choline oxidase at temperatures from 25 °C to 60 °C. A step-wise process is depicted in Fig. 1. Results: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of 11 choline oxidase sequences from different bacteria vs Arthrobacter globiformis choline oxidase showed that active site residues are highly conserved. The available crystal structure of A. globiformis choline oxidase with cofactor Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) in the dimeric state (PDB ID: 4MJW)1 was considered for molecular dynamics simulations. A simulated annealing option was used to gradually increase the temperature of the system from 25 °C to 60 °C. Analysis of the conserved residues, as well as residues involved in Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) binding, substrate binding, substate gating, and dimer formationwas done. At high temperatures, the formation of the inter-chain salt bridge between Arg50 and Glu63 was a significant observation near the active site of choline oxidase. Conclusion: Molecular dynamics studies suggest that an increase in temperature has a significant impact on the extended Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) binding region. These changes interfere with the entry of substrate to the active site of the enzyme and make the enzyme inactive. © 2024 The Author(s)",

      "Abstract": "Diabetes Mellitus is a harmful condition characterized by elevated blood sugar levels resulting from insufficient insulin production in the body. This disorder gives rise to various health complications affecting the kidneys, heart, nerves, and eyes. If left unidentified and untreated, it can even prove fatal. Therefore, early detection and prediction of chronic diseases are imperative, and advancements in technology have led to a shift towards personalized healthcare. Machine learning offers a viable solution for predicting the likelihood of developing the disease with satisfactory accuracy.The objective of this research is to create a machine learning-based model for accurately predicting early-stage diabetes mellitus. The study employs PCA for dimensionality reduction and the ensemble bagging decision tree classification, thereby, achieving a remarkable accuracy level concerning the disease. The proposed model is evaluated using a publicly available dataset of 520 instances. The dataset utilized in this research includes information such as Polyuria, Polydipsia, sudden_weight_loss and weakness etc. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 93.26%, precision of 96.9%, recall of 94.1%, and F-Score of 95.4%. Comparative analysis against other existing techniques demonstrates its superior performance in predicting such chronic conditions. © 2024 The Author(s).",

      "Abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the maxillary protraction effect of facemask therapy with and without skeletal anchorage in growing Class III patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP). Materials and Methods: Thirty patients (aged 9–13 years) with UCLP having a GOSLON score 3 were selected for this prospective clinical study. The patients were allocated into two groups using computer generated random number table. Group I (facemask therapy along with two I shaped miniplates, FM + MP) and Group II (facemask mask along with tooth-anchored appliance, FM). Skeletal and dental parameters were evaluated on pre- and post-treatment lateral cephalograms and pharyngeal airway on cone-beam computed tomography systems (CBCT) for assessment of the treatment changes. Results: Both methods proved to be effective with statistically significant improvements in skeletal and dental parameters (p <.05). Skeletal parameters (e.g., SNA, convexity-point A, ANB) with the FM + MP group showed greater change compared to those with FM group (SNA, 2.56°; convexity-point A, 1.22°; ANB, 0.35°). Significant proclination of maxillary incisors was observed in the FM group as compared to FM + MP group (U1 to NA, 5.4°; 3.37 mm). A statistically significant increase in pharyngeal airway volume was noted in both groups (p <.05). Conclusion: While both therapies are effective in protracting the maxilla in growing patients with UCLP, the FM + MP allows for a greater skeletal correction, minimizing the dental side effects seen with FM therapy alone. Thus, FM + MP appears to be a promising adjunct in reducing the severity of Class III skeletal correction needed in patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP). © 2023 Special Care Dentistry Association and Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

      "Abstract": "Tobacco is the only consumer product that kills half its users yearly. The challenges posed by tobacco control are limitless especially in a country like India where in addition to smoked forms, other smokeless forms of tobacco are also highly prevalent. Apart from being a health hazard tobacco is also a great environmental hazard. Policies for controlling tobacco use also include policy to prevent people from second hand smoke, which is aimed at improvement of air quality. According to the National Non-Communicable Disease Monitoring Survey, 2017-18, daily tobacco use was 32.8% in adults (18-69 years) and 3.1% in adolescents (15-17 years). Overall reduction in tobacco users by 8.1 Million was seen from GATS-1 to GATS-2, and prevalence amongst youth decreased from 18.4 to 12.4%. GYTS-4 (2019) revealed that 8.5% of students, 9.6% of boys and 7.4% of girls-currently used any tobacco products. This makes tobacco control a priority in India. Tobacco control consists of different approaches such as educational, healthcare, legislative, regulatory and fiscal. In the present article we traverse nearly five decades and decode the evolution of legislative, regulatory and fiscal approaches to Tobacco Control in India. A critical evaluation of all these approaches is described in the format of the MPOWER strategy for Tobacco Control which stands for Monitoring Tobacco use, Preventing people from Second Hand Smoke, Offering help to quit, Waring regarding ill effects of tobacco, Enforcing bans and Raising taxes on tobacco products. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

      "Abstract": "This work suggests using a fuzzy inference system controller to control vehicle movement. In a traffic lane scenario, it aids in the avoidance of collisions. It makes use of the fuzzy controller idea to both prevent collisions and regulate vehicle movement beneath roadside areas. The system's performance is assessed using a variety of metrics. It shows the situation where there are two or four cars in a single or two-lane stretch of road. It uses a controller to adhere to the left-side travel rule in every case. The controller is also used to present the vehicle's projected course. Additionally, their propagation velocity is assessed and quantified. In order to prevent unintentional collisions, it is helpful to determine the angle of propagation and the separation between other vehicles. © 2024, Auricle Global Society of Education and Research.

      "Abstract": "Objectives: The present study was conducted to assess tobacco use and its effect on Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) in Indian adolescents. Methods: The present study was conducted on 1,600 13–14 year old adolescents from the schools of Modinagar, western Uttar Pradesh, India selected using stratified random sampling technique. OHRQoL was assessed using Hindi version of Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ). Information regarding demographic, socioeconomic and oral health measures was also collected from the study participants. Tobacco use was assessed through questions derived from Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) questionnaire. Influence of predictor variables on tobacco use was evaluated using multilevel Poisson regression model. Results: The tobacco use among the study population was 8.1 % and CPQ scores were 9.15±0.32. Adolescents who used tobacco had worse OHRQoL scores. Low socioeconomic status, presence of dental caries, absence of regular dental visits (last 6 months) were associated with increased regular consumption of tobacco products. Conclusions: The findings of the present study play an important role in planning public health strategies to improve adolescent OHRQoL and reduce tobacco use. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

      "Abstract": "The endeavour of this research work is to scrutinize the effect of reinforcement materials: Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Graphite (Gr) on the mechanical properties of Al-Mg-Si alloy (AA6061). Sample of composites were fabricated using the stir casting technique, incorporating four weight (wt.) ratio of individual reinforcement and two different sizes of the particles. SiC, a resilient ceramic and graphite were chosen as reinforcements to estimate their shared impact on the mechanical characteristics of the composite. Hybrid Metal Matrix Composite (HMMCs) were created with varying weight percentage of 4%; 3%; 2%; 1% for the above selected reinforcements separately with two combinations of the particle dimensions: System-I (SiC-25 μm and Graphite-75 μm) and System-II (SiC-5 μm and Graphite-25 μm). Mechanical characterization of composite samples including hardness, wear rate, compressive strength, was analyzed for both System-I and System-II. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was employed for microstructure analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) for phase identifications. Mechanical characterization revealed both System-I & II with uniform dispersion of reinforcement particles. System-I exhibited higher density and lower wear resistance compared to System-II under all load conditions. © 2024 The Electrochemical Society (“ECS”).

      "Abstract": "Liquid crystalline materials have the property to flow like a liquid while maintaining their molecular order. They are valuable material for technological integration. In this work, we have investigated a chiral semi-fluorinated liquid crystal material with the chemical structure C21H17F2NCS in two distinct laterally fluorine-substituted configurations. Employing density functional theory computations, we undertake a comprehensive comparative analysis of both configurations, assessing their charge dynamics, electrical characteristics, thermochemical properties, and nonlinear attributes. Intriguingly, the configuration featuring fluorine substitution on adjacent benzene rings exhibits remarkably superior properties in contrast to its counterpart, where fluorine is substituted on the same benzene ring. This research underscores the significance of structural nuances in elucidating the enhanced performance of liquid crystalline materials. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

      "Abstract": "In recent years, a sudden upsurge in the quantity of municipal solid waste (MSW) has been observed, and the status quo demands a constructive and economically viable solution. The use of stabilized municipal solid waste (SMSW) in road construction can help in reducing the burden on landfills and waste management authorities. In the existing study, SMSW was accumulated from the Okhla landfill which is situated in New Delhi that is rich in an organic content. This SMSW was then blended with soil (5%, 10%, and 15%) and bottom ash with varying percentages (10%, 20%, 30%) individually and a mix of soil and bottom ash in the ratio of 1:1 to reduce the content of organic matter. The blended sample was then tested to check its compaction value, California bearing ratio (CBR), unconfined compressive strength (UCS), durability, and scanning electron microstructure (SEM). The results indicated that the addition of bottom ash to SMSW decreases the maximum dry unit weight that varies between 1.65 and 1.51 KN/m3 while this value reduces to 1.72 to 1.67 KN/m3 in the case of the bottom ash–soil blend. Also, CBR value reduces to 25.50 to 18.00% in case of bottom ash and 25.89 to 21.92% for bottom ash–soil samples and inverse in the case of SMSW samples blended with soil ranges between 19.95 and 22.59%. The California bearing ratio value of all samples under soaked condition meets the minimum criteria (&gt; 10%) as specified in IRC SP-72 for low-volume roads, but at the same time failed to meet the durability specifications. Thus, it is recommended to use this soil subgrade material in arid regions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.",

      "Abstract": "The mixed ion composite polymer electrolytes (MICPE) based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) complexed with different volumes of sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) and lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) salts were prepared by using solution cast technique. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the amorphicity of the sample. FTIR spectroscopy was used to characterize the structure of polymer which confirms the polymer and salt complex formation. The ionic conductivity of the sample electrolyte was found in the range of 10−2–10−4 S/cm at room temperature. The electrochemical potential window of the demonstrated samples was explored by Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) techniques. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to determine the glass transition temperatures of pure PVA and PVA doped with salts and plasticizer ethylene carbonate complexed films. Electrical conductivity was measured using ac impedance analyzer in the frequency range 101–106 Hz using AC impedance spectra on 10 mV applied voltage. The increase in the magnitude of electrical conductivity was observed with incorporation of plasticizer. The surface morphology and microstructural studies of synthesized samples were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The elemental analysis of the samples was done from Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDX) pattern graph. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

      "Abstract": "Globally, the utmost consideration in the manufacturing context is to implement the green process while operations because of awareness and the legal regulations. Besides the fruitful contributions of green manufacturing implementation on environment, a very few industries have adopted the green manufacturing concept. The reason behind the lower count are the factors that limit the implementation of green manufacturing. The present work is to identify the factors associated with green manufacturing which generally limits/affects the implementation of green manufacturing. Further, the work aims to develop the model which will rank all the identified barriers based on their impact on limiting/affecting the implementation of green manufacturing in the manufacturing industry. The fact behind identifying and ranking assigning to the factors associated with green manufacturing is to provide the better understanding to the present-day business owners to develop and prioritize the work strategies which help them in facilitation for the smooth implementation of green manufacturing. © 2024 AIP Publishing LLC.",

      "Abstract": "In the present context, the utility of mathematical modeling approaches in water management is increasing exponentially. These models are being used to manage the complex nature of water contamination and further in providing the quantitative forecasts. The larger application of these models is in managing of polluted water where it is difficult to get the exact information regarding the contamination.

      "Abstract": "The deathrate due to vehicles accident are increasing day by day. The major reason behind the deaths are the intensity of the accident and delay in the initial assistance. The present study tries to explore the option in the form of automated car accident alert. The alert system will be being actuated once it detects the accidental situations and start alarming. The system will detect the vehicle's situations like collision or rollover (during and after). In case of serious collision detection, the vehiclemodule quickly locates the accidental site and transmit the basic information to the nearest hospital/police station (whichever is closed to the accidental position) for the initial help. The proposed system can help the persons met causality during the accidents and can save many of the lives by alerting the back-up support systems. © 2024 AIP Publishing LLC.",

      "Abstract": "Leadership is the accomplishment of a goal through the direction of human assistants. A leader is the man who successfully marshals his human collaborators to achieve particular ends. A great leader is one who can do so day after day, and year after year, in a wide variety of circumstances. The new pattern of leadership has the combination of effective decision-making skills and analytical skills. Organizations can utilize analytics to find opportunities, set priorities, identify key obstacles, and gain a competitive edge. This study adds insight to business decision analytics with different leadership pattern and evaluates the differences and similarities of the theories to achieve better results in the organisation. The study proves that analytics in leadership and decision making is a new wave for business organizations. The industrial revolution 4.0 has also implemented changes in organizational working culture, employee welfare, employee engagement and management-oriented functions. The systematic literature review (SLR) also provides the acceptance to the importance of analytics in business decision-making on themes. © 2024 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "Anticipating the loads that buildings will bear is a crucial strategy in the pursuit of energy efficiency and the reduction of emissions. In this paper, we introduce an interactive and comprehensive joint prediction model, specifically crafted to elevate the precision of forecasts related to building loads. The resultant Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Machine (GA-SVM) prediction model is put into action to provide hourly predictions of cooling loads for buildings. In scenarios where the prediction of building cooling load (BCL) fluctuations becomes imperative, especially in the face of extreme weather conditions, the information granulation (IG) method is employed. The findings of this validation process unveil significant improvements. The coefficient of variation of root mean square error (CV-RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the GA-SVM model are reduced by 58.85% and 68.04%, respectively, when compared to the conventional SVM model. Furthermore, in a comparative analysis against three widely utilized prediction models, the SVM model demonstrates a reduction in CV-RMSE and MAPE ranging from 2.04% to 68.04%. The application of the joint prediction model showcases impressive results, with R2 values ranging from 97.27% to 99.68%, MAPE ranging from 2.59% to 2.84%, and CV-RMSE ranging from only 0.0249 to 0.0319. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

      "Abstract": "Statistical analysis is essential for minimizing the time, cost, and number of experiments needed to get the maximum output. In this work, the removal of cadmium bivalent (Cd (II)) ions was optimized using Box-Behnken design methodology. The effects of pH, concentration, time, and temperature were investigated for the removal of cadmium. Maximum removal (85.70 %) was achieved at pH of 5.34, initial Cd(II) ions concentration 46.61,contact time 166.09 (min), and at 59.40 °C temperature on Punica Granatum carpellary membrane powder (PGCMP) and 88.61 % removal was achieved on its modified forms (MPGCMP) at pH of 5.79, initial Cd(II) ions concentration 65.70,contact time 178.96, and at 59.91 °C temperature. The model was validated by analyzing variance (ANOVA). The practical data was well fitted to the quadratic model. PGCMP and MPGCMP were found to be naturally occurring, environmentally friendly adsorbents for the mitigation of Cd (II) ions as well as other toxic heavy metals from drinkable or wastewater. © 2024 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.",

      "Abstract": "Global warming and climate change condition are prevailing due to over exploitations of natural resources like fossil fuels, heavy metals, and dumping of wastages in open space. To bring solution to these less dense composite materials using waste biomass is now researched widely by scientists under various applications. The mechanical, tribological, wear, water absorption, and thermal conductivity properties of composite materials reinforced with bronze nanoparticles and areca fiber coated with vinyl silane are investigated in this research work. The novelty of this research study is to investigate how the composite’s characteristics were affected by the vinyl silane–treated bronze nanoparticle. Using a hand layup technique, the fabrication was cured for 24 h at ambient temperature and then post-cured at 120 °C. The AB2 (Areca fiber of 40 vol.%, Bronze nanoparticle of 3 vol.%) composite demonstrated stronger mechanical properties, including a tensile strength of 37.2%, a flexural strength of 22.4%, and an izod impact strength of 36.6% when compared to fiber- and matrix-reinforced base composite AB0 (areca fiber 40 vol.%, resin 60 vol.%, bronze nanoparticle 0 vol.%). In contrast, the AB3 composite displayed remarkable hardness at 84 Shore-D, outstanding wear resistance at 0.011 mm3/Nm, superior thermal conductivity at 0.212 W/mK, and excellent hydrophobicity at 0.12%. Further, when compared to the thermal conductivity of AB3 composite shows 34.2% higher than the thermal conductivity of base composite AB0. Similar such increase in values is attained in other composites compared to AB0 composite. Furthermore, vinyl silane–treated bronze nanoparticles are present in greater volume fractions in AB2 and AB3, which increase reinforcement inside the composite matrix and improve mechanical characteristics. The SEM (scanning electron microscopy) results corroborate that the vinyl silane treatment improved the bond strength of the fiber, filler, and resin. The reinforcement of vinyl silane–treated metallic nanoparticle and natural fiber reinforcement shows better mechanical, wear resistance, and thermal stability property which could be utilized in areas such as automotive, aerospace, defense, and structural applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Gears are pivotal components within power transmission systems, responsible for driving a majority of rotating machinery in industrial contexts. Optimizing their design is imperative to improve power transmission efficiency. Gear failure often stems from contact stress surpassing the material's fatigue strength, resulting from repeated loading on the tooth surface. This research primarily centered on conducting static stress analysis on spur gears to determine equivalent stress, principal stress intensity, total deformation, and shear stress. The process commenced with 3-D modeling of the gear, incorporating technical specifications using Solidworks software, followed by finite element analysis (FEA) in ANSYS software. FEA analysis was conducted to assess the performance disparity between cast iron gears and epoxy matrix-based composite gears. The composite gears comprised a consistent composition of 1% boron carbide and glass particles, with reinforcement weight percentages varying at 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%. The specifications for the spur gear were derived from the gear box of the TATA Super ACE commercial vehicle. The simulation takes into account variables such as load distribution, stress concentrations, and structural integrity, offering a comprehensive understanding of composite gear performance. Analysis reveals that among all materials, the polymer composite with 20% glass particles and 1% boron carbide displayed the least total deformation. Additionally, the equivalent stress and shear stress decreased with increasing reinforcement content in the epoxy polymer, with these stresses being higher in the polymer composite compared to cast iron. However, the disparity in equivalent stress and shear stress between cast iron and polymer composite was negligible. Principal stress was observed to escalate with higher reinforcement particle content. Integrating ANSYS simulations with cast iron and epoxy-based composite materials can enhance the effectiveness and reliability of gears in a range of engineering applications. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "The growth of software-defined networking (SDN) enhances network strength and provides flexible routing, especially in heterogeneous environments. Hence, an efficient framework is required for recent networks. Recently, hybrid SDN with the restricted deployment of SDN switches has been integrated with a conventional network that provides improved communication performance compared to traditional SDN systems. However, the recent hybrid SDNs lack effective link protection and optimal routing when used with complex topologies. Hence, this study presents a novel deep learning–based hybridized multi-stacked autoencoder with the duo-directed gated recurrent unit (MSAE-DDGRU) for automatic link failure prediction in hybrid SDN. Moreover, a multi-objective zebra optimizer (MO-ZeO) is introduced to perform optimal routing by solving multiple routing constraints. The developed study is processed with the Python platform, and publicly available GEANT topology is utilized for the whole experimental process. Various assessment measures like accuracy, precision, sensitivity, packet loss, cost, maximum link utilization (MLU), policy violation rates (PVRs), packet delivery ratio (PDR), and delay are analyzed and compared with existing studies. The developed technique achieved an accuracy of 96%, precision of 92%, sensitivity of 93%, PDR of 99.4%, PVR of 0.0005, and delay of 1.2 s are obtained. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

      "Abstract": "This study explores the transformative potential of sustainable pork production and processing as a tool to empower tribal women in the northeast region (NER) of India. The NER is faced with multiple challenges, such as poverty, gender inequality, and poor livelihood methods. Therefore, enhancing sustainable production and processing methods for pork, which is their staple food, presents not only an opportunity for the socio-economic development of the region but also an effective tool for the economic empowerment of tribal women. Through a primary survey of pork value chain actors in Assam, Meghalaya, and Nagaland (the largest producers and consumers of pork in the NER), the study outlines the current practices and barriers to sustainable pork production methods. Although the consumption of pork has remained unchanged and that of processed pork items is on the rise, the production of pork is drastically declining. Therefore, reviving pork production in the NER can be instrumental in building sustainable livelihood models, especially for tribal women in the region. The study explores the effectiveness of a community-based, ‘model village approach,’ where capacity building around sustainable pork production, processing, and waste management techniques results in the economic empowerment of women. The findings from the post-impact analysis of the capacity-building approach call for policy intervention and the establishment of supportive networks to enhance the growth of a sustainable pork production system across NER, thereby contributing to the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets proposed by the Indian economy.

      "Abstract": "In the world of wireless sensor networks (WSN), the constraint of limited energy resources owing to battery dependency needs effective energy management solutions to extend network longevity. Among the various options, clustering has emerged as a pivotal technique for increasing energy efficiency. The paper delves into the critical challenge of optimally clustering sensor nodes (CN) to extend the operational longevity of WSNs amidst the burgeoning data demands. The paper presents an analytical methodology to generate the optimal number of clusters, which is supplemented by the development of a centralized clustering algorithm. Furthermore, the present research outlines the implementation of a decentralized clustering framework that employs the fuzzy C-means algorithm. Comprehensive simulations are used to compare the proposed algorithm with the established Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed (HEED) clustering technique. The findings clearly demonstrate the increased efficiency of our proposed algorithm in optimizing energy consumption and extending network lifespan, indicating a significant step forward in optimizing Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for future high-density data processing requirements. © 2024, Collegium Basilea.

By mapping international standards guidelines with Indian reporting guidelines, the study has created a pragmatic and standardised tool for measuring and comparing the sustainability disclosure practices of India’s top-listed firms. The finding of the study highlights a unique and stringent reality in the corporate sustainability reporting practices of India’s top-listed firms. Despite a consistent style of reporting throughout the year, the data reveals a concerning trend where social dimensions of sustainability are given more attention than the environmental and economic dimensions. Hence, the study aims to not only inform but also empower stakeholders with the necessary information to drive sustainable change in the Indian corporate landscape. © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",

      "Abstract": "The Indian handicraft industry has contributed to India’s economy by employing the economically weaker society, especially women. Due to a lack of awareness and knowledge related to recent marketing trends, Indian artisans face many challenges in reaching their target audience. The study has highlighted 15 critical factors that influence digital platforms in the handicraft industry. Pearson correlation was employed for analysing the relation between random factors, with 98% significance. Secondly, the weights of the factors were derived using principal component analysis (PCA). The Pearson relation shows that proper training and generation of awareness will increase tax collection, and direct selling will enhance the broader coverage of the market. The PCA outlines the internet and connectivity as the most critical factor with weight (11.2), followed by gender bias (10.8) and digital illiteracy (10.36). The negligence of the factors creates a barrier to using digital marketing platforms. The study indicates that due to a lack of awareness and knowledge related to recent marketing trends, Indian artisans face a lot of challenges to reach their target audience. © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",

      "Abstract": "Biocontaminants is a broad term that encompasses a panorama of toxicants, microbes, and other pollutants of biological origin, including viruses, fungi, bacteria, algae, mites, insects, and pollen grains. Their origin can be traced through their sources that are highly diverse and comprise articles and materials in human vicinity such as home furnishings, air conditioners (ACs), humidifiers, kitchen surfaces, bathroom objects and surfaces, household pets, construction sites, building materials, dust particles, plants, and many more. Biocontaminants, being omnipresent, have a profound impact on the environment and human health as they cause several types of communicable or noncommunicable diseases and other ailments that compromise the quality of human life and in certain instances lead to severe morbidity and mortality. Indoor confinement of humans has not only increased the biocontaminants in the microenvironments but has also contributed to the enhanced burden of diseases. The chapter gives an overview of the occurrence and types of biocontaminants in various microenvironments, factors that are instrumental in their build-up, and conditions supporting their spread within and across various indoor microenvironments. The chapter also proposes various measures that would help restrict the spread and sustenance of biocontaminants and prevent related diseases in indoor occupants. © 2024 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

      "Abstract": "In contemporary times, the pivotal significance of robots, artificial intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT) technology has fundamentally transformed the healthcare sector. Healthcare businesses are progressively embracing artificial intelligence (AI) and its associated technologies in response to their growing prevalence in the corporate domain. The use of these technologies holds the promise of enhancing several aspects of patient care and administrative procedures within providers, beneficiaries, and pharmaceutical entities. There has been a growing potential for advanced robotics to significantly benefit the healthcare sector in recent years, owing to notable developments in several current technologies. A robot may be defined as a mechanized system that is programmed and actuated, with a certain level of autonomy. Medical robotics has seen significant advancements since the first development of prototypes based on industrial robots during the 1960s-1970s. Initial versions of these technologies have undergone significant development and have transformed into advanced and complex platforms that support doctors, patients, and attendants in modern healthcare environments. With time, robots have shown their utility and undergone advancements, enabling them to work inside restricted environments within the human anatomy, aid individuals in regaining the functionality of wounded limbs, and assist those with physical and cognitive impairments. Nevertheless, the use of robots in the healthcare sector may be controversial due to apprehensions about financial implications, accessibility of skilled workforce, and opposition towards embracing technological advancements. The dissemination of these technologies to the country’s peripheral settlements and rural areas, which most people inhabit, poses the most significant challenge. This chapter presents a comprehensive review of the current state of robotics in the healthcare industry, highlighting the associated issues and obstacles. © 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.",

      "Abstract": "The present study aimed to isolate a bioflocculating fungal strain from wastewater collected from a local bike garage. The isolate showed maximum similarity to Aspergillus species. The fungus was identified as Aspergillus flavus species F_GTAF1 IU (accession no OP703382). The isolated fungus was evaluated in terms of biomass recovery efficiency in Scenedesmus Sp. GTAF01. The extent of algal fungal co-pelletization was evaluated as a function of the algae-to-fungi ratio, volume of fungal culture in broth, agitation rate, and pH. results showed that at fungal culture volume of 60░%v/v, fungal culture volume of 1:3░%w/w, 100 rpm, and pH 3, 93.6░% biomass was obtained during the initial 5 h. At wavenumbers 1384 and 1024 cm-1 a significant alteration in the transmission percentage was observed in co-pellet compared to algae and fungal cells. This shows the significant role of C-H–H and C-N stretches in co-pellet formation. This study provides deep insight into effective microalgal harvesting along with the simultaneous extraction of lipids that can be used for the sustainable production of biodiesel. © 2024 The Authors",

      "Abstract": "Software-defined networking (SDN) is a network framework that decouples the network’s control from its data-forwarding operations, concentrates on intelligence, and isolates the network’s fundamental architecture from various applications and services. With the help of a hybrid SDN framework, legacy and SDN protocols can coexist and function in the same setting. However, the hybrid structure makes managing traffic in the hybrid SDN difficult. Segment routing produces control overheads due to the incorporation of extra packet headers. Still, the network congestion, higher packet loss rate and energy usage make routing a challenging task. Hence, a novel segment routing using the proposed Gannet artificial humming optimisation (GAho) algorithm. The proposed GAho utilises the multi-objective fitness function based on link quality and flow features to make congestion-free routing. The performance analysis of GAho based segment routing using the delay, throughput, jitter, and packet drop acquired the values of 4.24 ms, 77.61%, 0.15 sec, and 1.82%, respectively.

      "Abstract": "Certificate authenticity and validity are becoming increasingly important in various fields, such as education, professional licensing, and various types of documentation. However, secure distributed systems are subject to hacker attacks and data tampering leading to failure of whole system. The paper presents the results of a detailed survey obtained from various stakeholders of certificate management to emphasize the need of decentralized, immutable, secure, and transparent permissioned blockchain network with consortium consensus to ensure that the authorized issuers can issue certificates directly on the network. Confidentiality hashing algorithms and digital signature services provide input data integrity, endorsement, and non-repudiation. The paper discusses the need of a decentralized system that can be designed using Hyperledger Fabric. The proposed system is expected to be safe for certificate management, reducing the risk of centralized systems by using decentralization and cryptographic primitives. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "World’s population is growing rapidly and it will touch 10 million by the end of 2050. Availability of clean and safe water for all is a global challenge. Disinfection of water is the most important step in water treatment to ensure the inactivation of pathogens from water. There are many techniques/materials avail able for disinfection of water. However, there are also many challenges associated with successful implementation of methods of disinfection including cost, type of pathogens, and other health implications caused due to formation of disinfection byproducts during the disinfection process. In this chapter, the background of water disinfection techniques as well as recent trends of the area has been discussed in detail with an objective to suggest safer strategies for water disinfection. Disinfection by-products often lead to health implications due to their long-lasting and toxic behavior. There are many other factors including pH, residence period, temperature, natural organic matter, and other water characteristics that significantly affect the efficiency of disinfectants and fate of disinfection by-products. Some by-products are carcinogenic, reproductive toxicants as well as mutagenic in nature. However, with advancements in disinfection techniques formation of toxic by-products can be avoided during water treatment. These methods have been discussed in the chapter along with the challenges and knowledge gaps to provide a basic outlook for future research in the development of safer disinfection alternatives. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence refers to computer systems or devices that can learn and become better at doing tasks by mimicking human intellect. There are many places where AI is being put to good use, from hospitals and clinics to research facilities and labs. Management of treatment and examinations are essential to AI's use in medicine. The success of AI systems in healthcare is due to the creation of complex algorithms that can pull valuable information from vast amounts of healthcare data. Auto-learning capabilities may be added to the algorithms to boost efficiency and precision. Artificial intelligence technologies provide doctors with sophisticated medical information from journals, clinical papers, and textbooks for quick patient treatment. AI has the potential to reduce human error in both diagnosis and treatment. Medical data, especially that relating to patients, may be used for the learning process. Biomarkers, NLP, expert systems based on rules, and physical robots are all examples of forms of AI that have applications in healthcare. Treatment planning, illness tracking, diagnostic help, and patient monitoring are all areas where AI has been useful. This paper attempts to demonstrate the importance of AI in healthcare by looking at the different technologies used in India's Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and Ayushman Bharat health protection schemes to improve the quality of care and patient satisfaction. In India, proper health screening is one of the most important things. So, learning how AI will affect healthcare services, professional practice, and infrastructure is essential. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "TLS (transport layer security) fingerprinting relies on the assumption that different HTTPS clients (programs, PC programs, etc.) support different computa-tions. The TLS focuses on providing security to insurance (characterization), depend-ability, and utilizing cryptography, similar to announcements and around granting system applications. As demonstrated by this show detail, TLS includes two layers: the TLS record show and the TLS Hand-shake show. This suggests the once-over of maintained codes and developments that a client gives to the server during the TLS Hand-shake. TLS fingerprinting is the detailed verification of a client considering the fields in its Client Howdy msg. during a TLS Hand-shake. Two or three typical moti-vations behind TLS fingerprinting: to collect information about a client on the Web, such as working system or program interpretation. There are three main elements which helps in achieving the TLS purpose: encryption, confirmation, and reliability. Encryption covers the data being moved from outcasts. Approval ensures that the social affairs exchanging information are who they assure to be: typical applications that use TLS to consolidate Web programs, messaging, email, and voice-over IP.TLS is ordinarily executed on top of TCP to scramble Application Layer shows like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and IMAP. Nonetheless, it may be done on UDP, DCCP, and SCTP (for instance, for VPN-and Taste-based applications used). This is known as Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), not entirely set in stone in RFCs 6083, 6347, and 5238. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.",

      "Abstract": "Reduced groundwater levels, glaciers melting into the oceans, contaminated rivers, and other issues are ultimately caused by the rising demand for freshwater brought on by population growth and other factors. Water scarcity is a severe issue in almost every region of the world, necessitating the collection and storage of rainwater, a different supply of freshwater. Due to criteria like a large permanent area and expensive installation costs, traditional and commercial rainwater harvesting systems cannot be currently placed everywhere. As a result, a lot of rainwater is wasted every year and very little rainwater is gathered. This study suggests a portable rainwater collecting kit to address these issues because it can be installed in a small space and doesn’t require a huge permanent installation budget. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Purpose: Student engagement is a multifaceted concept that encompasses various dimensions that significantly influence students and their learning journey. This study aims to explore the extent of engagement among management students outside the confines of the classroom, specifically focusing on their engagement with the campus and community and assessing the outcomes resulting from this engagement. Design/methodology/approach: The literature review provided the basis for developing a student engagement framework, focusing on campus and community engagement and their outcomes. Established scales measured these variables through surveys administered to 386 UG and PG management students. In-depth analysis using PLS-SEM technique revealed the interplay of variables, beyond demographic and descriptive examinations. Findings: The study found that campus and community engagement fosters a sense of responsibility. Campus engagement also cultivates long-term loyalty to the institution, while community engagement enhances social consciousness. Additionally, no significant differences in engagement levels were observed based on gender or educational level among management students. Research limitations/implications: The study faces limitations that need addressing for balanced understanding and future research guidance. Firstly, varying definitions across studies lead to inconsistent outcomes and comparability challenges. Secondly, accurate measurement is difficult due to reliance on self-reporting tools, which are prone to biases. Cultural and contextual differences also limit generalizability, and quantitative data alone may not capture the full picture. In India, identifying specific skills and competencies as engagement outcomes in outcome-based education is challenging, requiring precise variable identification. Practical implications: The study would contribute to improving the efficacy of efforts beyond the classroom engagement activities as it tests, validates, and projects them as outcome-driven by showcasing learning both as generic competencies in a broad sense and higher-order competencies in particular. Originality/value: The literature indicates higher education institutes' activities beyond classroom teaching enhance students' campus and community relationships. This study measures these engagements' outcomes and suggests new research dimensions in student engagement. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

      "Abstract": "Statement of problem: How osseodensification osteotomy affects the implant stability and crestal bone level in patients requiring implant placement in low-density bone compared with conventional osteotomy is unclear. Purpose: This systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed how implant stability and crestal bone level vary in a low-density bone in osseodensification osteotomy and conventional osteotomy. Material and methods: The SCOPUS, PUBMED, and Google Scholar databases were searched, along with a manual search, for articles published between January 2013 and January 2024. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed to select the studies for review. A total of 5 studies were included in this systematic review. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tools were used to conduct the risk of assessment of the included articles, and forest plots were generated for the included articles (α=.05). Results: The data were assimilated from a small sample size of 109 patients and 198 implants. The meta-analysis found that osseodensification resulted in significantly higher implant stability quotient (P<.05) values at baseline and follow-up, while the crestal bone level changes were not found to be significant (P>.05) at baseline or on follow-up visits. Conclusions: The osseodensification drilling protocol displayed an advantage over the conventional drilling protocol regarding higher primary stability and secondary stability, as well as bone expansion in low-density bone. No significant difference in crestal bone loss was found in either technique at baseline or at follow-up. © 2024 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry",

      "Abstract": "Honey is a natural product that contains various nutritive components as a part of its composition. It contains vitamins, minerals, enzymes, amino acids, etc. Those crucial from the point of therapeutic application are the flavonoids and phenolic compounds. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of honey’s polyphenol and flavonoid content play a significant role in its therapeutic effects. Some of the phenolic acids known to have anti-obesity and anti-hyperlipidaemic properties are polyphenols such as caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, and gallic acid. Honey has antioxidant, anti-microbial, and anti-inflammatory properties, despite the fact that the bioactive potential is linked to the composition, which varies depending on the botanical origin of different geographical locations. More research is being conducted on the effects of honey on blood sugar, body weight, lipid profile, C-reactive protein, nitric oxide, proinflammatory prostaglandins, and homocysteine. Honey is being used in patients with diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and CVD, according to growing evidence and scientific data. Many studies have found that honey can help reverse metabolic syndrome by acting as an anti-obesity, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, and hypotensive agent. The current review’s goal is to summarize the current literature on honey’s beneficial effects in the management of metabolic diseases including neurodegeneration diseases, obesity-related diseases, hypertension, diabetes etc. This chapter highlights honey as potentially responsible for the health benefits. To validate these benefits in humans, additional well-designed and controlled studies are required to be done in the years to come. © 2024 CRC Press.",

      "Abstract": "As demand for advanced cooling technologies for electronics with high-power IC packages (microchips) grows, the MCHS has become a popular medium for cooling. In this study, different shapes of MCHS have been used to enhance the efficiency of heat transfer at the time of cooling. CFD approach was employed to inspect the effect of the designs of microchannel on the efficiency of heat transfer. For geometric modeling and simulation of the systems, an ANSYS workbench 2022 was employed in the present work. Aluminum alloy with given properties was used as a material for the microchannel’s physical modeling. To achieve heat dissipation and efficiency, the flow, dimension, and surface area of the microchannel were considered, and having a good surface finish, orientation, and size of the microchannel in which a direct impact is produced from the heat sink while heat transfer. By using CFD analysis, pressure, heat transfer rate, static temperature, mass flow rate, friction factor, and wall temperature were evaluated. In conclusion, the use of microchannels has become increasingly popular due to the improved transfer of heat efficiency they provide. Different shapes and designs of MCHS have been developed to increase performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "In this study, heat transfer analysis for turbine blades was carried out using the Computational fluid dynamics approach. For the geometric modeling, Solidworks 2022 was used and an ANSYS workbench was employed for the simulation of a turbine blade. The materials must endure high vibrations, temperature, force, and pressure. This study aims to investigate how heat is transferred across the surface of the turbine blade and identify areas that exhibit notable temperature, stress, and strain differences. The analysis considers both convective heat transfer, which occurs due to the flow of hot gases, and conductive heat transfer which takes place within the blade material. So, two materials were used for the analysis, i.e., Titanium alloy and Inconel 718. After meshing, the element's number is 279357 and the node's number is 476430. A numerical study was carried out for the turbine blade designed for a gas turbine under the load of 5000 N with a rotational velocity of 1000 rad/s. Further, plastic deformation, stress, and strain were computed. So, the Titanium alloy has higher deformation, stress, and strain than Inconel 718. According to the study, Inconel 718 is a suitable material for turbine blades. The results obtained from the CFD simulations provide valuable insights into the thermal behavior of the turbine blade. CFD analysis empowers engineers and designers to optimize cooling design, material selection, and operating conditions for turbine blades, leading to enhanced performance, efficiency, and lifespan. This study also adds to the overall understanding of heat transfer in gas turbine systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "The use of enhanced designs can efficiently and economically reduce the efforts necessary to produce desired results. One of the most important parts of an engine, the piston, which comes into contact with the working substance, must be designed so that the maximum amount of energy released by the working substance is converted into useful work. It must also function harmoniously with other parts of the engine to reduce process losses and increase efficiency. A comparative study has been done on thermal and structural analysis for pistons while using carbon and aluminum alloy in IC engines. In this paper, the study revealed that aluminum alloy can handle more load than carbon, heat flux is also low in carbon pistons, and the stress developed on the piston head is low in aluminum as compared to carbon. This study concludes that aluminum alloy could withstand higher loads better than carbon for the piston. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "The demand for advanced turbine blade materials that can withstand high temperatures and harsh conditions has increased. This study uses Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis to investigate how metal turbine blades perform under different thermal parameters. The objective is to analyze the impact of temperature gradients and heat transfer coefficients on blade aerodynamics and structural integrity. Geometric modeling was done using Solidworks, and turbine blade simulation was done by using the ANSYS Workbench. It finds that temperature gradients, strain, plastic deformation, and stress significantly affect the efficiency and structural integrity of the blades. The study also compares various metal materials used for turbine blades, revealing their specific responses to thermal parameters. Haynes 230 and Ti–6Al–4V were the two materials employed in this study for the analysis. The number of elements and nodes discovered by mesh were 174410 and 291884, respectively. The outcomes of this study hold substantial implications for turbine blade design and material selection, facilitating the development of more robust and efficient turbine systems. By comparing the two materials employed for the turbine blade, Haynes 230 has lower deformation, stress, and strain than Ti–6Al–4V. So, Haynes 230 is a suitable material for the turbine blade. By comprehending the relationship between thermal parameters and material performance, engineers can optimize blade design, enhance cooling strategies, and improve the overall reliability and durability of turbine blades. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Objectives: The tobacco epidemic is more than just a health concern. It is a socioeconomic one with far-reaching effects. Smoking being the most common mode of tobacco use worldwide, has an impact on human life and well-being. Hence, this study aimed to seek the knowledge and awareness of adolescents about e-cigarettes and spread awareness about the harmful effects of vapig so as to reduce the ongoing rise in cigarette consumption among these individuals. Methods: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 100 teenage children of urban schools in Delhi NCR of age group 14–17 years which collected information on teenage vaping practices, views about vaping, and their accessibility to vaping items. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Program for Social Sciences – SPSS version 25 through frequency and percent, graphs, Bar chart and Chi-squared test. Results: A total 100 participants took part in the survey out of which of 59 were males and 41 were females. A significant proportion of the participants (94 %) possessed knowledge of e-cigarettes, and 14 % had actually used them at some point. Most of the participants were aware of the disposable variety of e-cigarettes and most of them thought that e-cigarettes were less addictive. Conclusions: A significant portion of educated young adults who have never vaped are susceptible to using e-cigarettes in the future. It is also discovered that e-cigarettes are still available and being promoted in spite of the restrictions. In addition to good health education for minors, more stringent enforcement of current rules and monitoring could help prevent larger uptake in the future. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

      "Abstract": "Because the microgrid (MG) differs from traditional generators in its dynamic properties,, the greater penetration of RES-based MGs into the power system may have an impact on system stability. Therefore, it becomes crucial to evaluate the recently established dynamic stability issues and manage the power system's operation in the context of growing microgrid penetration. This paper describes a microgrid system aided by renewable energy that uses an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based PID controller and superconducting magnetic energy system (SMES) storage. Microgrid contains two energy sources wind energy and PV solar panel. The energy generated by them is supplied to load and extra energy is stored in SMES. The PID controller is used in a feedback system to control the flow of energy. This research investigates in detail how the penetration of microgrids based on renewable energy affects the Stability and management of the multi-machine, multi-area system dynamically in a range of operational scenarios. A brief wind power prediction model based on ELM is developed. For this system, a new robust ELM-controlled PID-based power system stabilizer (PSS) is proposed. In spite of all the uncertainty, the system is guaranteed to stay stable by the ELM control technique. The ELM technique is used in order to optimize the controller's parameters, and the resulting controller beats both regular PID and fractional order PID (FoPID) controllers in terms of performance. The controller's ability to attenuate oscillations at low frequencies in a system with varying microgrid penetration percentages under varied operational settings and disturbances is evaluated using nonlinear time-domain simulations and many execution indicators. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "With improvements in machine learning technology, viable methods for processing the massive amounts of data created in real life are now available. However, data protection and scalability concerns will slow down the further development of machine learning algorithms. Federated learning (FL) prevents data leaks by distributing training jobs to numerous clients and thus isolating the central server from the local devices. Nevertheless, FL still has issues like malicious data and single points of failure. Blockchain Technology's debut offers a secure and practical solution for FL deployment. This research study presents a comprehensive evaluation of the blockchain-based FL. First, the concept of Federated Learning is extensively dwelled upon. Then, the limitations of Federated Learning were analyzed, which led to the adoption of BC-FL. Some real-world uses of BCFL are also analyzed. Subsequently, the integration of BC with FL has been studied. Finally, the architecture of BC-FL has been developed and described. BC-FL is an upcoming research field that is comparatively unexplored. The paper offers insights into its development and how the technology can be implemented by addressing data privacy and security issues. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "Thermal images play a crucial role in various applications, such as environmental monitoring, energy efficiency, and food safety. However, thermal images are often affected by low spatial resolution, limited accuracy, and noise, which reduce their usefulness and effectiveness. This research paper presents a novel approach for enhancing thermal images and optimizing using Kriging Interpolation KI. The proposed KI method combines a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), with Kriging, a geostatistical method for interpolation and prediction of spatially continuous variables. The proposed KI method has been evaluated on a set of low-resolution Land surface temperature (LST) images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite and validated with higher resolution LandSat-8 LST. The use of PSO in combination with Kriging provides a powerful tool for efficient and accurate spatial enhancement of thermal images, allowing for the preservation of important thermal features and details while improving the overall quality of the images. The proposed KI algorithm demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach in enhancing the spatial resolution and accuracy of the MODIS thermal images. The results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional statistical LST image enhancement methods, such as DisTrad, TsHarp, and Regression Tree in terms of spatial resolution and accuracy. The proposed method has potential applications in agricultural, metrological, and environmental applications, where thermal images are used to continuously monitor and control temperature-sensitive data. © Indian Society of Remote Sensing 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Big data, which incorporates hidden information or patterns for decision-making, is produced by the healthcare industry in vast quantities. Resolutions that are made with more accuracy than intuition are based on the vast amount of data. Finding relevant data, verifying assumptions, identifying errors, and establishing the association between the explanatory factors are all achieved by means of investigative data analysis, or EDA. EDA is defined as data analysis in this instance, which excludes statistical modelling or conclusions. With its ability to predict the future and reveal hidden patterns, analytics is a crucial skill for any career. Data analytics is a crucial tool in healthcare, particularly in relation to emerging research, emergencies, and disease outbreaks. It has been deemed a cost-effective technique in recent times. EDA is a crucial stage in the data analysis process, and the application of analytics in healthcare enhances care by supporting preventive care. In several cities with poor work-life balance, Med Camp hosts health camps. They approach those in the workforce and urge encouraging people to enroll in these wellness camps. Depending on how the camp is set up, participants at Med Camp may choose to visit various booths to raise awareness or receive health exams. This study discusses Med Camp's health camps, which are available in several places with low work-life balance. Approach those who are employed and urge them to sign up for these health camps. Over the course of four years, Med Camp has conducted 65 of these events, and during that time, they have seen a notable decrease in both 'Registration' and number of individuals undertaking tests at the camps. All through the past four years, they have kept around 110,000 enrollments. These Med camps to find the cause of several health issues and predicted using machine learning techniques. The study covers classifier performances, assessment measures, and preprocessing procedures. The results section's data visualization illustrates how well the machine learning approach predicted the outcome. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "This research employed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for comparison between two different microchannel shapes of microchannel heat sinks. Latent heat of MCHS are vital cooling techniques for electronic systems. Their geometry is one element that profoundly affects their performance. In this study, the hydrodynamic and thermal performances of MCHS with different microchannel shapes (e.g., conventional square, round-corner-square) are compared. CFD simulations were used to evaluate the fluid flow and heat transfer in MCHS. Varied parameters included surface roughness, aspect ratio, and Reynolds number. This paper presents detailed numerical simulations for each microchannel shape to explore pressure loss, thermal uniformity, and actual heat dissipation efficiency. Commercial CFD software was employed to carry out computations. In fact, the results of the study provide the advantages and disadvantages of different microchannel designs for cooling application which go far beyond mere numbers. As microchannels, if they are rectangular and do not have rounded corners square microchannels possess the most obvious advantages in terms of practical. But in sum will bring a better heat transfer rate and still at less pressure drop. These findings will have far-reaching consequences for heat transfer problems which involve flow through capillary tubes, ease of fabrication, or void fraction predictions, just like the prediction of heat transfer correctly, fabricating locally at will and obtaining an excellent flow control. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "In the agricultural sector, tomato leaf diseases signify a lot because they result in a lower crop yield and quality. Timely detection and classification of diseases help to ensure early interventions and effective treatment solutions. Nonetheless, the existing methods are confined by the dataset imbalance which affects class distribution negatively and thus results in poor models, especially for rare diseases. The research is designed to improve the capability of tomato leaf disease identification by investing a new deep-learning method beyond the challenge of imbalanced class distribution. By balancing the dataset, we aim to improve classification accuracy as we pay more attention to the under-represented classes. The proposed GAN-based method that combines the Weighted Loss Function to produce tomato leaf disease synthetic images is underrepresented. They improve the quality of the entire dataset, and the images from every class are now in a more balanced proportion. A CNN, which is the convolutional neural network, is trained for the classifier, with the weighted loss function as a part of the model. We used Genetic Algorithm (GA) for hyperparameter optimization of the CNN. It helps in emphasizing the learning process from the under-represented class. The suggested one will not only decrease the accuracy of tomato leaf disease detection but also increase it. Therefore, the synthetic images created by GAN enhance the dataset since the class distribution is brought to equilibrium. The incorporation of the weighted loss function into the model’s training process makes it very effective in handling with the class instability problem and consequently, the model can identify both common and rare diseases. From the outcomes of this study, it can be concluded that it is feasible to employ GAN and one loser weights function to solve the problem of class imbalance in tomato leaf disease recognition. A suggested approach that increases the model’s accuracy and reliability could be a good move to enhancing a reliable method of disease detection in the agricultural sector. © 2024, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

      "Abstract": "The present study is to investigate amino acid compositions and protein characteristics of gluten extracted from different varieties of wheat and their influence on the pasting properties of starch. The starch and gluten are isolated separately from 12 wheat varieties categorized by grain hardness, i.e., hard (HW), medium hard (MHW), and soft (SW)with value ranged from 83 to 95, 72 to 80, and 17 to 29, respectively. Amino acid profiling reveals significant variations among the wheat varieties, with extraordinarily soft wheat (Ex-SW) varieties exhibited higher levels of essential amino acid including methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, threonine, isoleucine, histidine, lysine, and valine. Protein fraction analysis indicates that gluten from HW varieties has a higher proportion of gliadin and lower glutenin content compared to MHW and Ex-SW varieties. Furthermore, starch from Ex-SW varieties possesses higher pasting parameters than MHW and HW varieties. Further, incorporation of gluten significantly reduced the pasting characteristics of starch. Flours with higher protein content demonstrate lower paste breakdown, highlighting the influence of protein content on viscoelastic properties. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) reveals associations between specific amino acids and protein fractions with various pasting properties, highlighting the complex interplay between gluten composition and starch behavior. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",

      "Abstract": "This paper explores the impact of encapsulation techniques on bioactive compounds, vitamins, and minerals, which are crucial for delivering bioactive compounds. Due to their instability and reactivity with the environment, encapsulation is often necessary to make these compounds suitable for medical or dietary applications. The evaluation of the kinetic model of bioactives reveals that encapsulation can significantly enhance their stability. However, encapsulation is not without its drawbacks. Incomplete encapsulation can reduce the effectiveness of the bioactives, and complexity of encapsulation processes can hinder widespread adoption. Interactions between the encapsulated materials and the encapsulating agents may also impact the release and bioavailability of the bioactives. It also presents perspectives for future research aimed at overcoming the limitations and enhancing the effectiveness of encapsulation. As research continues to advance, encapsulation is poised to play critical role in improving the delivery and stability of bioactive compounds, benefiting the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Background: Oral cancer is a significant health concern with limited effective treatment options. Curcumin, a compound found in turmeric, has shown promise in cancer therapy due to its anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. Liposomal curcumin enhances the bioavailability and efficacy of curcumin. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effectiveness of liposomal curcumin in treating oral cancer. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal curcumin as a therapeutic agent for oral cancer through a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of existing studies. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in major databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published up to Dec 2023. Criteria for inclusion involved clinical trials, case studies, and observational studies assessing the use of liposomal curcumin in oral cancer treatment. Data on treatment outcomes, adverse effects, and overall efficacy were extracted and analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using meta-analysis tools to determine the pooled effect size. Results: Liposomal curcumin significantly improved bioavailability and exhibited notable anti-tumor effects, including apoptosis induction and proliferation suppression, in preclinical studies. Despite limited clinical trials specific to oral cancer, ongoing research suggests its potential for enhancing treatment outcomes. Conclusion: Liposomal curcumin appears to be an effective adjunctive treatment for oral cancer, offering potential benefits in enhancing therapeutic outcomes and reducing adverse effects. Further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods is recommended to confirm these findings and establish optimal dosing protocols. © 2024, Collegium Basilea.

      "Abstract": "In the light of COVID-19, which has been announced as a global pandemic by the world health organization, it becomes paramount to take the necessary measures to control the possible spread of this highly spread contagious virus in Indian context. The present research aims to discuss the factors that help in deciding the strategies for reducing/elimination chain transmission. For this, an attempt has been made on the identified factors and to rank them according to their impacts on causing the chain transmission with the help of the total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) approach. Further, the factor categorization among the clusters is done by using MICMAC analysis to reveal the nature of factors that further helps in discussing the conclusion. The study advocates that there is rapid growth in increasing the cases of COVID-19 in the crowded cities and, mostly detected in the persons travelling from the other countries to India from February 2020 to September 2020. The factors CoF1 and CoF5 are concluded as significant and responsible for the rising number of COVID-19 and it is proposed that these factors should be addressed first to have the better control on the possible transmission. Further, the report also reveals that the asymptomatic cases (CoF7) have a high dependence power which states that this factor is influenced by the presence of other factors. In these extreme conditions, this study aptly reports the precautionary measures to prevent the increasing active cases of COVID-19. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Parkinson is an aging-related, progressive neurodegenerative disease that impacts both motor and cognitive function. Although the exact origin of Parkinson disease is largely unknown, genetic and environmental factors are probably involved. In contrast, the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease at the network level is quite well characterized. Treatment options for Parkinson disease's motor symptoms are pretty good. Deep brain stimulation is also frequently used to treat Parkinson's disease that is resistant to medicines. Parkinson's disease can be challenging to diagnose, especially in its early stages when symptoms may be subtle. Doctors working with Parkinson's patients realized the value of the data generated during diagnosis and treatment and recognized that machine learning algorithms could help identify patterns and biomarkers that might not be apparent through traditional diagnostic methods. In this research study, first the basic clinical aspects of Parkinson disease are reviewed and then the detection or symptoms and classification of Parkinson disease have been implemented using different deep learning algorithms. Six different deep learning algorithms Naive Bayes Classifier, Minimum Distance Classifier using the K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier in Logistic Regression, MLP Classifier and Decision Tree classifier have been analyzed and compared for the most optimum results for prediction of Parkinson's disease. The results show how effective and precise the deep learning algorithms are there in Parkinson disease forecasting. This research study attempts to work in the domain of Parkinson disease detection using deep learning algorithms. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of sensor nodes that detect, process, and transmit various types of information to a base station unit. The development of energy-efficient routing protocols is a crucial challenge in WSNs. This study proposes a novel algorithm called RMOWOA, i.e., Revamped Multi-Objective Whale Optimization Algorithm, which utilizes concentric circles with different radii to partition the network. The circles are divided into eight equal sectors, and sections are formed at the intersections of sectors and layers. Each section contains a small number of nodes, and an agent is selected based on specific criteria. The nodes within each section transmit their detected information to the corresponding agent or cluster head. This process is repeated until the base station receives the data. The selection of agents is based on a WOA-based approach, known for enhancing the network's lifetime. The selected agent aggregates the data, performs redundant residue number-based error detection and rectification, and forwards the information to the lower segment's agent within that sector. The proposed RMOWOA algorithm is evaluated through simulation analysis and compared with established benchmark cluster head selection schemes such as SFA- Cluster Head Selection, FCGWO-Cluster Head Selection, and ABC-Cluster Head Selection. The experimental results of the RMOWOA algorithm demonstrate reduced energy consumption and extended network lifespan by effectively balancing the ratio of alive and dead nodes in WSNs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",

      "Abstract": "The development of a thermal power plant can include different difficulties and issues that need to be addressed. High pressures and temperatures are required for operation in thermal power plants and components are subjected to abrasive particles, corrosive gases, high-velocity steam, and aggressive environments. Several researchers have tested P-92 steel materials for their compatibility and effectiveness as construction material for thermal power plants, and this study reviews the mechanical properties and chemical compositions of P-92 steel materials based on experimental and simulated data from various research papers. Different welding techniques, including TIG, A-TIG, G-TAW, and SAW, are utilized to analyze the microstructures, mechanical properties, and chemical compositions of welds made from P-92 steel. The utilization of nanoindentation enables the examination of localized properties in the welded joints. Findings reveal a reduction in hardness within the CF-tested sample when contrasted with the as-welded counterpart, with a notable softening observed, especially in the areas extending from the CGHAZ to the FGHAZ. P-92 steel exhibits exceptional resistance to high temperatures while maintaining its structural integrity and mechanical properties. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "The main reaction to the illicit extraction of natural resources in protected areas around the world is law enforcement patrols headed by rangers. On the other hand, research on patrols' efficacy in reducing criminal behavior is lacking. Similarly, tactics to enhance the effectiveness of patrol organization and monitoring have received very little attention. Sequencing is crucial for model training, feature selection, and preprocessing. Preprocessing steps include cleaning, discretizing, duplicating, and normalizing data. Feature selection makes use of genetic algorithms, which are basically search algorithms with an evolutionary bent that factor in natural selection and genetics. Training stacked GRU models necessitates meticulous feature management. Even the most cutting-edge algorithms, GRU and BiGRU, are no match for the suggested technique. An astounding 97.24% accuracy grade was disclosed by the results, showcasing exceptional growth. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "Due to population explosion over the last few decades, erection of high-rise buildings has increased twofold all around the world. The buildings thus constructed to accommodate the increased population must be designed safe and robust. But more often than not, these structures were built without the consideration of proper codes or were built before the publication of the codes that are current and henceforth, poses a threat to the life of human and its occupants. Within these parameters, wind loading are often overlooked in design and these in turn can causes large displacement when resonant over a period of time. Wind is composed of a multitude of eddies of rotational characteristics and varying sizes carried along in a general stream of air moving relative to the earth's surface. These make it a complex phenomenon when high-rise structures were taken into account. Thus, there arise a need to necessitate the use of wind analysis on high-rise structures. This study was conducted on an already existing G + 16 building located at Delhi NCR and subjecting it to the code appropriate loading cases inclusive of wind loading. Preliminary and Detailed Evaluation of Comparative Assessment through Vulnerability was conducted through wind analysis on STAAD.Pro and ETABS 2018, for which parameters such as Displacement and Drifts were analysed and assessed. All the above results will be studied thoroughly to draw conclusions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "With an increase in the rate of occurrence of natural disasters, especially Geophysical Disasters such as Earthquakes, there is a need to built the structures as per the guidelines given by the respective nations worldwide while designing and analysis of the structures. The main concern arises that how to strengthen the existing structures, constructed in past decades, with little or no codal guidelines with respective to seismicity. It is an alarming situation for the structures which falls under the category of semi-tall and tall structures. This paper focused on consideration of a residential complex located in the high seismic zone of Northern India: Delhi, NCR. Three different structural models had been considered of varying heights and then were analysed under the effect of different types of loadings as per IS 875 (Part I), IS 875 (Part II), IS 1893: 2016 (Part I), and IS 16700—2017. The structures are classified as small structures, semi-tall structure, and tall structure as per the guidelines from IS 16700—2017. To get the analytical results and compare the seismic behaviour of the structures, the dimensions of the structural elements are kept same. The structural models had been analysed using ETABS—2018, under the effect of P–∆ Analysis. The results are reported by considering parameters such as Maximum Storey Displacement and Drift; with Time Period, under P—∆ Analysis, a correlation factor had also be generated to associate the results obtained for the parameters taken into consideration. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "The rapid urbanization and economic growth of Uzbekistan over the past decades have engendered significant changes in automobile ownership trends. Understanding these trends is crucial for infrastructure planning, sustainable transportation strategies, and environmental considerations. This Paper seeks to employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to forecast the number of cars per 100 households in Uzbekistan by 2025, based on historical data from 2010, 2015, and 2020. The dataset, derived from official statistics provided by the State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics, shows a remarkable increase from 21 cars per 100 households in 2010 to 48 by 2020. Leveraging regression models, we aim to predict the expected growth for 2025. Preliminary analyses hint at a continuing upward trend, impacted potentially by factors such as Population growth, GDP growth, urban migration, and increasing global connectivity. The findings from this research will not only serve as a prediction tool but will also shed light on the socio-economic factors influencing car ownership, providing valuable insights to policymakers and urban planners. While the limited data points present a challenge for complex model utilization, the study underscores the potential of ML in forecasting and the need for more comprehensive data collection in future studies. The predictive insights drawn from this research can significantly aid in shaping transportation policies, mitigating potential environmental impacts, and planning urban infrastructures in Uzbekistan. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Recent studies highlight the majority of existing structures located in the seismic-prone regions all over the world often found to be designed with poor or without the consideration of the seismic designs and/or are variously incompetent in the sight of the principles of seismic designs used currently. Earthquakes, even with a moment magnitude of 6.0 are capable of causing extensive loss of structural compatibility and hence structures need to be evaluated in the sight of the current codes available and provisions of retrofitting should be incorporated, if necessary. In this study, a school building located in Imphal, Manipur was considered and conducted a vulnerability assessment through incorporation of preliminary and detailed assessment analysed by ETABS 2018 software with Pushover analysis. Then the actual model was modified to three different models by keeping intact the materials and section details same as the actual model to study how change in geometrical configuration impacted the structural integrity. Formation of Plastic Hinges through Pushover analysis were pre-eminently considered towards Collapsed Prevention (CP) level. The structural elements with CP level hinges were then retrofitted by using RC jacketing, steel jacketing, and bracings. The deflections from the retrofitting processes were compared to the actual model and the pushover curves were then used to carry out an assessment study and evaluate the effectiveness of the strengthening programme. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Due to rising demand for energy-efficient buildings, advanced predictive models are needed to evaluate heating and cooling load requirements. This research presents a unified strategy that blends LSTM networks and GBM to improve building energy load estimates’ precision and reliability. Data on energy usage, weather conditions, occupancy trends, and building features is collected and prepared to start the process. GBM model attributes are created using sequential relationships and initial load projections using LSTM networks. Combining LSTM with GBM takes advantage of each model's strengths: LSTM's sequential data processing and GBM's complex nonlinear connection capture. Performance measures like RMSE and MAE are used to evaluate the hybrid model's validity. Compared to individual models, the integrated LSTM-GBM method improves prediction accuracy. This higher predictive capacity allows real-time energy management systems, improving building operations and reducing energy use. Implementing this integrated model in Building Management Systems (BMS) shows its practicality in achieving sustainable building energy efficiency. © The Author(s) 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Abrasive water jet machining (AWJM) is extensively employed for machining composites such as glass fibre-reinforced polymers (GFRP). AWJM is proven to be efficient and economical for material processing in manufacturing industries, in which a high-speed abrasive water jet is impinged on workpiece surface to erode material to get the desired shape. In this paper, experiments are performed to study the kerf taper (Kt) in AWJ machined GFRP composite according to response surface methodology (RSM) based on the central composite design (CCD) approach. Water pressure (WP), traverse rate (TR), stand-off distance (SOD) and abrasive mass flow rate (AMFR) are considered to study their influence on kerf taper. Optimisation of parameters is executed by applying the desirability technique to minimise the kerf taper. In order to validate the results, confirmation tests have been carried out and which show less than 4.535% of error. Thereafter, an experimental model (second-order mathematical) is made for kerf taper by using RSM. From the analysis, it has been found that the predicted values are very close to the experimental results with a deviation of less than 4%. © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",

      "Abstract": "The main aim of the article is to identify and understand the existing ritualistic practices followed in Mithila (a community in India) to nurture and imbibe values among the younger generation. The phenomenon being studied is ‘unconscious conditioning’ within the context of ‘Mithila culture’, using analytical psychology and Triguna theory. Both primary and secondary data have been used for this case study. The respondents were chosen through purposive sampling keeping the objective of the paper in mind. Secondary data included literature in the forms of books, articles and papers which have been written on the said topic. Constructivist grounded theory has been used to analyse the data. The findings show that there are different stages that an individual goes through to gain balance between the conscious and the unconscious. These stages are like stepping stones to attaining wholeness or in Maslow’s terms ‘self-actualization’. Ritualistic practices, traditional motifs and drawings become an integral part of one’s psyche and influence everyday decision-making process. These practices are especially important during major transitions in life—like birth, death, weddings and so on, making it easier and more comfortable for the said individual. The article helps us understand the linkage between analytical psychology, Triguna theory and its implication in our lives. © 2024 Birla Institute of Management Technology.",

      "Abstract": "Many scholars have focused their attention on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) within the last ten years. QoS control, Energy intake, MAC protocols, routing protocols, statis-tics aggregation, self-organizing net algorithms, Internet of Things (IoT), and so forth are among the research topics that have been thoroughly studied recently. Historically, the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has not been fully realized due to constraints in data processing capabilities and energy efficiency. Nonetheless, the unique characteristics of neural networks can be harnessed for complex tasks, such as the role of travel advisors. This research aims to combine IoT and WSN technologies to enhance Quality of Service (QoS) parameters including reliability, energy, conservation, system scalability and response time. It provides an overview of the key components and techniques utilized in WSNs to achieve QoS. The objective of the proposed article is to compare the performance of two widely used route paradigms, Energy-Aware Routing and Directed Diffusion, with the proposed routing technique called Sensor Intelligence Routing (SIR). The foundation of Sensor Intelligence Routing (SIR) is the incorporation of neural networks into discrete sensor networks. WSN simulation, OLIMPO (an ad-hoc wireless sensor network simulator for optimal scada-applications) has been used in multiple simulations to examine how well neural networks perform within the system. The results obtained from every routing method have been compared and analyzed. The paper also aims at fostering the use of IoT-based synthetic intelligence techniques. © 2024 Sonia Singh and Neha Gupta.",

      "Abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a single-stranded RNA virus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, poses a significant global health threat, with severe complications observed in vulnerable populations. The only licensed vaccine, IXCHIQ, approved by the US FDA, is insufficient to address the growing disease burden, particularly in endemic regions lacking herd immunity. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), explicitly targeting structural proteins E1/E2, demonstrate promise in passive transfer studies, with mouse and human-derived mAbs showing protective efficacy. This article explores various vaccine candidates, including live attenuated, killed, nucleic acid-based (DNA/RNA), virus-like particle, chimeric, subunit, and adenovirus vectored vaccines. RNA vaccines have emerged as promising candidates due to their rapid response capabilities and enhanced safety profile. This review underscores the importance of the E1 and E2 proteins as immunogens, emphasizing their antigenic potential. Several vaccine candidates, such as CHIKV/IRES, measles vector (MV-CHIK), synthetic DNA-encoded antibodies, and mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccines, demonstrate encouraging preclinical and clinical results. In addition to identifying potential molecular targets for antiviral therapy, the study looks into the roles played by Toll-like receptors, RIG-I, and NOD-like receptors in the immune response to CHIKV. It also offers insights into novel tactics and promising vaccine candidates. This article discusses potential antiviral targets, the significance of E1 and E2 proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and RNA vaccines as prospective Chikungunya virus vaccine candidates.

      "Abstract": "In the event of an epileptic attack, the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-accelerated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is paired with Electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition equipment to produce a reliable production system that can be used in clinical medical diagnosis. Additionally, this study includes cybersecurity to protect both the epileptic patient’s data and the prediction system. Epilepsy is a frequent neurological disorder that manifests as recurrent seizures, a sign that indicates rapid intervention is necessary to minimize adverse events and improve patient health. The study provides a new real-time design for predicting epileptic seizures based on the Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)-based Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) architecture. As a first step, EEG data from epilepsy patients were captured and pre-processed. Afterwards, faults and artefacts in the data were removed. Additionally, data was divided into short-time windows and then classified as either ictal, pre-seizure, or interictal. The CNN model was adapted for EEG signal analysis and then trained with categorized data. This technique is more effective and efficient for predicting epileptic seizures accurately, which is advantageous for patient monitoring and treatment. Additionally, cybersecurity measures were implemented to secure patient data and the prediction system. © 2024, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG). All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "In this work, the development of an aircraft bracket through the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process is presented. The numerical model developed in this study is employed to predict thermal stresses and displacement of parts throughout the additive manufacturing process. To achieve a reduction in volume and, subsequently, the design space of the aircraft bracket, a geometry optimization technique - Topology Optimization is implemented. Additionally, the 3D Printed Titanium alloy aircraft bracket is subjected to industry-standard loading for analysis. In the simulation model, new elements are activated for every layer to simulate the recoating of filament powder, and the thermal gradient, thermal stress, and displacement of parts associated with each layer are computed. Notably, the topology optimization of the geometry demonstrates a considerable reduction in residual stress generation and a significant decrease in mass. The Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method is employed in this study for topology optimization. The quality of the printed part is notably influenced by the geometry of the bracket. The findings of this study contribute to advancing the understanding of the interplay between topology optimization and additive manufacturing and highlight their collective potential for shaping the future of aerospace equipment fabrication. A volume percentage ranging from 50 to 75% of the original mass was allocated to guide the optimization process. The optimized geometry at 75% volume demonstrates the greatest reduction in residual stress generation compared to the original implant. This improvement in stress distribution is significant for aerospace brackets, as it allows for the development of lighter, stronger brackets manufactured more affordably using the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process compared to conventional processes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature 2024.",

      "Abstract": "DMT as a therapy is among the new entrants in the field of psychology, which explores the connection between the inner world to that of the outside world through the expression of body movement. This connection between the two worlds has created a lot of curiosity both positive and negative in the field. This curiosity arises from the fact that even before the child is born, he uses his body to interact with the world outside. These movements precede even the first cry of the baby, implying that movement in any form is the most natural expression of emotions. Hence, to understand these natural movements and how it helps individuals to come in term with themselves we have used autoethnography as the primary research data. This has helped us to understand the process or the journey that a practitioner goes through while undergoing the DMT course. Analytical psychology was used as a theoretical anchoring to understand the conscious and the unconscious processes. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

      "Abstract": "This study investigates how control, concentration, and enjoyment impact customers’ awe experience in e-tailing, and examines how AI-enabled services may alter online flow dynamics. The research employed cutting-edge data collection techniques using an AI-driven platform developed by an Indian online survey firm. Participants were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk and snowball sampling. Variables were measured using a Likert-type scale, with survey credibility and validity ensured through rigorous measures, including feedback collection and analysis. Through a novel research model and the ‘broaden-and-build theory,’ the study reveals that customers’ awe experience can be significantly influenced by control and concentration. Surprisingly, AI-powered e-retail services negatively affected two flow dimensions and subsequent awe experience. However, customers’ awe experience positively correlated with AI service quality, indicating emotions’ criticality. These findings provide new insights for future research and e-tailers to design effective marketing strategies enhancing customer journeys. The study underscores the importance of fashion retailers embracing AI technology to meet dynamic customer expectations, yielding enhanced efficiency and cost-effectiveness through process automation and waste minimization. By integrating AI, the industry undergoes a significant transformation, effectively redefining the shopping experience. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

      "Abstract": "Objective: To assess the oral health status and microbiota of subgingival plaque in patients with surgically repaired cleft lip and palate (CLP) during orthodontic treatment for maxillary protraction with two different orthodontic appliances. Design: Randomized controlled trial Setting: Institutional. Participants: A total of 90 patients with surgically repaired Unilateral Cleft Lip and Palate, out of initially enrolled 120 patients, were divided into 3 groups: experimental group I, experimental group II and control group, with 30 subjects each. Patients with a history of oral prophylaxis in last 6 months or antibiotic therapy within 3 months were excluded from the study. Interventions: Bone Anchored Maxillary Protraction was done in experimental group I, while facemask with acrylic occlusal splint was used for maxillary protraction in experimental group II and no orthodontic intervention in control group. Mean Outcome Measures: Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI), Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI), Probing Depth (PD), and microbiota of subgingival plaque (P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, Veillonella and Capnocytophaga) were compared at baseline (T0) and after 8 months (T1). Results: The PI, GI, GBI and PD were observed to be significantly higher in experimental group II followed by experimental group I as compared to control group at 8 months interval (P &lt;.001). The microbiota counts increased significantly in experimental group II and experimental group I (P &lt;.001), as compared to control group. Conclusion: Maxillary protraction with facemask and bone plates was found to be a better alternative than facemask with occlusal splint, considering the overall oral health of patients with CLP. © 2024, American Cleft Palate Craniofacial Association.",

      "Abstract": "Negation is a universal linguistic phenomenon that affects the performance of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, especially opinion mining data. Many words exists in sentences that have multiple interpretations or sentiments depending on how they are placed with respect to the negation word in the sentence. A cutting-edge framework is designed to tackle the nuanced challenge of detecting contextual ambiguity through negation in sentiment analysis. The approach uniquely combines advanced natural language processing techniques with deep linguistic insights, enabling the accurate interpretation of sentiment in complex sentences where negation plays a key role. The framework identifies negation cues and their scope, then assesses their impact on sentiment, considering contextual dependencies and word semantics. The model's innovation lies in context-sensitive algorithms that adeptly handle different sentence structures and idiomatic expressions, a notable advancement over traditional sentiment analysis tools. Particularly effective in interpreting sarcastic or ironic statements, the framework significantly outperforms existing models in accuracy, especially in negation-heavy contexts. This advancement enhances sentiment analysis applications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis, offering a more nuanced understanding of public opinion. © 2024 University North.

      "Abstract": "By the game-changing possibilities of credit scoring models driven by the Internet of Things, this hopes to shed light on how the banking sector may enhance its loan decision-making procedures. Financial organisations are putting more and more faith in Internet of Things technologies to improve their risk assessment and lending processes. These IoT-driven models provide a more accurate and thorough assessment of creditworthiness by including real-time and detailed data on borrowers' activities, spending habits, and asset utilisation. This research examines the practicality and accuracy of Internet of Things (IoT) credit scoring by comparing it to conventional methods, looking closely at case researches, and analysing empirical data. The findings shed light on potential ways to enhance the loan approval and risk prediction procedures while also addressing concerns and considerations related to data privacy, security, and regulatory compliance. It is possible that decision-making frameworks could be altered by IoT-driven credit scoring algorithms, which could lead to a more inclusive and informed lending atmosphere. The contributes to the growing area of banking credit evaluation by showing that these models have promise. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "Determining the potential interactions between ligands and proteins is a crucial first step in developing new drugs. Graph BAR, our novel prediction model, makes accurate guesses about the strength of ligand-protein bindings by means of a graph convolutional neural network. When compared to graph convolutional neural networks, standard convolutional neural network models are more resource and time intensive to manage. The interaction between proteins and ligands is shown via a network consisting of many adjacency meshes. The atomic distances dictate the alterations to these matrices. Additionally, the atomic properties can be shown in a feature matrix. Using the PDBbind datasets, we verified the functionality of graph convolution and evaluated Graph BAR's ability to forecast the binding strengths of proteins and ligands. In order to maximize The model's performance was improved by utilizing ways for adding additional input, which took advantage of the processing capability of graph convolutional neural networks. Graph BAR's predictions appear to have potential for use in drug creation due to its great accuracy and quickness. The results of our research suggest that Graph Convolutional Networks have the potential to expedite the discovery of new medications by properly predicting the interactions between pharmaceuticals and proteins. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "As trivial as it is for humans to identify, locate, and distinguish objects from their backgrounds and other objects, for computer systems, it is not so trivial. In Computer Science domain, the topic of Object detection addresses this issue. Object detection is one of the core tasks of computer vision, which lays the foundation for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation etc. The last two decades have seen the tremendous evolution of object detection methods, from the Voila Jones detector to deep learning models to transformer-based models. The recent trends in the field are YOLO models and transformer-based models (such as DETR). We aim to explore object detection using YOLO and pure transformer ViT, do a comparative study, and furthermore, explore the theoretical approach of the hybrid model of YOLO and ViT. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "The traditional treatment for endometrial cancer is surgery in which the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries are removed. Other treatments that are helpful to treat early-stage endometrial cancer include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. The main concern of artificial intelligence (AI) is to design intelligent systems that have human capabilities, such as thinking, learning, reasoning, problem solving, and so on. This could be accomplished through the determination of knowledge representation, rule-based systems, search, learning, and so on to solve real-world problems. Of these, knowledge is the main player, as it is the skeleton of all the methods. Knowledge representation has two different entities: facts and the representation of facts. Facts about situations must be represented logically so that the program can understand the situation effectively. Muticriteria decision-making techniques have been used for decision-making purposes across disciplines. In this chapter, we use an intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy prioritized weighted average (ITrFPWA) operator to select suitable treatment for early-stage endometrial cancer. We discuss the algorithm based on the given operator in the intuitionistic fuzzy environment step by step and then demonstrate its effectiveness by considering a hypothetical case study based on the intuitionistic fuzzy information gathered from three medical experts about the diseases and their likely remedies. The outcome of the algorithm is the ranking of the treatments for the given information. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disease (ASD) is a neuro developmental illness that is both complicated and degenerative. A majority of known approaches use autism detection observation schedule (ADOS), pattern recognition, etc. to detect ASD with a small dataset, resulting in high accuracy but low generality. In this research, an ASD detection hybrid model is presented which is works on two different types of datasets. Firstly, behavioural datasets which works on logistic regression technique and secondly, facial dataset which works on based on convolutional neural network (CNN) Classifier in order to predict whether a person is suffering from autism or not. The suggested hybrid model which works on behavioural and facial dataset of a person beats state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, according to simulation findings. The proposed hybrid model had an average accuracy of 88% for the logistic regression model while it achieved an accuracy of 82.76% for the CNN model. © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",

      "Abstract": "Topic modeling, a conventional technique for uncovering hidden themes in textual data, has garnered substantial attention across various fields. While it is highly effective, it presents several challenges during application. The foremost challenge lies in the selection of the most suitable topic model across diverse datasets and evaluation criteria. As the field continuously evolves, there arises a necessity to objectively compare and assess the effectiveness of different topic modeling algorithms. This study aims to evaluate the performance of conventional topic modeling algorithms, with respect to various internal quality metrics. By conducting an in-depth analysis and interpretation of results using the 20-Newsgroup dataset, we analyzed various topic models, determining the optimal model. This study incorporates comprehensive range of metrics, including aspects like model coherence, diversity, classification, and significance, to assess the performance of these algorithms. The outcomes of this work provide readers deeper insights into the effectiveness of topic modeling algorithms. © 2024 The Author(s).",

      "Abstract": "The increased use of micro- and nanoplastics (MiNaPs) has been reported by various researchers. Plastic materials that are sustained in the environment disintegrate into smaller parts and thus pose diverse challenges for different forms of life with which they come in contact with. The release of these particles cannot be attributed only to industries or households. The repercussions are borne by the environment in general and by receptors in particular. Recently, much has been reported about how MiNaPs have been affecting the aquatic environment and disturbing the ecology. They are persistent environmental pollutants with more than 90% of the plastic particle load in an environment composed of microplastic fragments. The high surface-area-to-volume ratio of microplastics makes them effective sorbents for harmful compounds. The presence of MiNaPs in the atmosphere will eventually impact all forms of life, with varied impacts depending upon concentration, time of exposure, etc. Airborne MiNaPs can travel long distances from their source and are deposited in terrestrial and aquatic environments, thereby causing varied damage to the receptors. An attempt was made to study the sources, origins, and impacts of MiNaPs. All major reasons, after the effects and scope of research regarding MiNaPs, are discussed here. © 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.",

      "Abstract": "Pasteurization is a necessary process that has to be done in order to ensure the health of the general public and for consumption dates (perished goods). The employment of artificial intelligence in pasteurization changes the course of technology and embodies a radical leap forward in food safety and quality. Artificial intelligence integrates precision, control, and efficiency levels of pasteurization mainstreamed traditionally by conventional food processing methods. Several artificial intelligence applications have been implemented for microbiological safety assessment, predictive modelling, and optimization of pasteurization processes that aim to reduce failure costs due to recall incidents and the necessity for costly quality assurance control measures. By using AI to process, industries can customize the pasteurization temperature and duration of heat in order to sterilize harmful bacteria and pathogens while preserving nutrition. AI also means predictive modelling and in the long run that will help dramatically decrease energy by curbing food waste which affects operational costs and sustainability. The present paper aims to provide an overview of artificial intelligence concerning food pasteurization in terms of process optimization, monitoring and control, microbiological safety assessment, and predictive modelling. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Recently, machine learning has changed the field of bioinformatics by making it possible to identify and understand protein structures in ways that were not possible before. This paper gives a thorough examination of a unique way for guessing protein structure. It uses complex machine learning algorithms to give you deep biological information. We use cutting-edge deep learning models along with traditional computer methods to improve the accuracy and usefulness of predicting protein structures. The suggested AI-assisted method uses a variety of protein structures and attention processes to find complex spatial connections and long-range interactions within protein sequences. It does this by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and CNNs. Using machine learning to predict protein structures can be very useful, and this work shows how it can effectively connect computational biology and experimental research. Our method not only makes predictive modeling better, but it also gives researchers a useful way to learn more about the complex links between protein structure and function as the field grows. The study's results could speed up the process of finding new drugs and help us learn more about how different diseases work at the molecular level. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "One of the numerous possible advantages of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Robot-Assisted Surgery (RAS) in the operating theatre is improved surgical accuracy and patient outcomes. We carried out a thorough investigation here to better comprehend this overlap. The study used a rigorous methodology that focused on making up information while collecting, analyzing, and testing data. The adoption of AI-driven Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) was linked to a statistically significant drop in surgical problem rates across all surgical groups, with a mean rate of around 14.36%, in a descriptive analysis of surgical complication rates. These findings demonstrate the potential therapeutic value of integrating RAS and AI. The goal is to shape a healthcare landscape that is characterized by precision, efficiency, personalization, and universal access to cutting-edge healthcare technologies, and the way forward includes rigorous clinical validation, AI model refinement, interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical considerations, costeffectiveness analysis, and a commitment to global accessibility. The combination of RAS and AI has the potential to revolutionize surgical procedures and improve health outcomes for people all across the world. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "The uncertain world bordering on the indeterminate ushers new challenges today while the industry tries to sustain the existing and decipher the future. Towards that endeavour, it looks for adaptive agility, empathy, dedication, interpersonal sensitivity as prerequisites to excellence and as attributes in their recruits to handle work demands that arise in a tumultuous corporate environment. To assess the veracity of this requirement, the present study tries to explore the importance of life skills learnt at the school/college level for job readiness and job sustenance. It also aims to find out whether life skills become a key deciding factor at the final stage of the corporate selection process and their transferability from one area of action (school/college) to the arena of corporate selection process and finally to the area of action/implementation, the workplace. Additionally, it also provides a framework to prepare students for better alignment with changing industry. Copyright © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",

      "Abstract": "The phenomenon referred to by the phrase “artificial intelligence” has the potential to have both positive and negative impacts on individuals and the environment, and there is now a substantial amount of attention put on the research and assessment of these effects. The United Nations 2015 developed a set of seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which included social, economic, and environmental objectives. This chapter introduces two theoretical models that may be used to determine how Artificial intelligence fits in with overall objectives. It argues that the current concentration on AI applications risks leading to disappointment, even as AI, in every sense, is likely to play a crucial role in efforts to accomplish the SDGs. First, it frames the issue within the larger one of aligning international Research & Development activities with the SDGs. This chapter focuses on presenting and discussing up-to-date information on the degrees of alignments and disarray and the potential for alternate configurations to create more precise routes. These are starting to appear from the food business to the energy industry, but AI and the digital world have some catching up to do. Second, it shows how different forms of AI may play different helpful and required roles in achieving Sustainable Development Goals in different contexts, such as cities, regions, and nations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Most people choose to acquire their news quickly and affordably via the internet, yet this encourages the fast spread of false information. Today’s society depends heavily on data, and by 2023, 120 zeta bytes will be released every second. This enormous amount of data is transforming the world thanks to several technologies. People rely on online news sources to stay current on events as the Internet has grown in popularity. With the growth of social media sites like Instagram, YouTube and Facebook, information spreads quickly to people all over the world in a short amount of time. Fake news might also proliferate because of this, which would have an impact on both society and people. Fake news must be discovered and eradicated before it further harms the country. Because of how false news functions, it may be hard to spot. In this paper, we provide a paradigm for recognising fake news. The research is conducted on Python using Scikit-Learn and NLP-util library. The research examines detecting fake news and investigating traditional machine learning models to determine the best approach. The data was utilised to train seven classifiers using the TF-IDF and count vectorizer, and the results to select the best suited features to get the greatest accuracy and F1-score are shown using confusion matrix.

      "Abstract": "This paper aims at development and characterization of copper metal matrix composites (MMCs) reinforced with graphene particles for application in electrical contacts. The composite specimens were synthesized using pressure-less sintering. The copper powders were mixed using ball milling process and thereafter were cold pressed in a closed mold. The powdered mix was then heated in a sintering furnace at a temperature of 900 ºC. The composite samples were synthesized with 0.5 wt%, 1.0 wt%, 1.5 wt% and 2.0 wt% of graphene concentration. The characterizations included X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), measurement of density, hardness, tensile strength, compressive strength, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and wear rate. XRD and SEM indicated uniform dispersion of graphene within the Cu matrix. Elemental mapping indicated by EDS confirmed the presence of graphene with in the matrix with higher peak intensities for the specimen containing higher wt% of the reinforcement concentration. Density of the composites was found to decrease with the increase in graphene content. Lowest density (8.06 g/cc) was observed in the composite specimen containing 2.0 wt% of graphene. Hardness of the composites increased with the increase in graphene concentration. Highest hardness was exhibited by composite specimen containing 2.0 wt% graphene. Maximum tensile (145 MPa) and compressive strength (156 MPa) was obtained for composite specimen containing 0.5 wt%, beyond which the strengths showed a decreasing trend. Electrical and thermal conductivity values of 74% IACS and 398 W/Mk were obtained for composite specimen containing 0.5 wt% graphene. Wear behavior of the composite materials was found to be dependent on graphene concentration. Resistance to wear was found to increase with the concentration of graphene. Lowest volume loss was observed for composite specimen containing 2.0 wt% reinforcement. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Bio gas tank is used to make & store the Bio gas (gobar gas). With the sources of fuel running out, then arise the necessity of replacement by bio gas which can be used to some extent. To store bio gas, large size of tanks is needed and such are classified on the basis of shape and location. It is to be noted that the analysis of Bio gas tank is similar to that of water tank irrespective of the chemical nature of stored products. All the tanks are basically analysed as crack free structure to eliminate any leakage. Mainly tank is analysed for Dead and Live loads (Vertical Loads) and it's been seen the tanks are critical either under seismic and or/wind load (horizontal load). In order to better understand the consequences of lateral loads on tanks, structural engineers are concerned about the analysis of these existing structures. The objective of this paper was to understand and conduct a comparative assessment of circular tank under seismic & wind analysis through comparison of deflection using STAAD. Pro software in addition to study the effectiveness of a Nominal Vs Stepped RCC wall. For seismic and wind analysis the most critical relevant zone was selected as per IS Code. The model was checked and analysed for serviceable load combination. The finality of results for the analysis were wholly based on the software. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

      "Abstract": "Background: Education in any dental institution and curriculum plays a vital role in the growth of students, which will help them acclimatize to the increased demand for dentistry. Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the students' perception of course curricula in three dental institutes in the Delhi-NCR region among undergraduate students and interns. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate students from first year till interns in three dental institutes of the Delhi-NCR region based on the Dundee Ready Educational Environment Measure (DREEM) questionnaire. The DREEM questionnaire was distributed using Google Forms. Six hundred seventy students from three institutes participated in the questionnaire, and data were tabulated and subjected to statistical analysis by the Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann-Whitney test. Results: The total mean DREEM score was 158.8/200 in the present study, which is excellent. The overall scoring of the domain showed a significant difference for the fourth BDS for students' perception of atmosphere (P = 0.001) and for the third-year students for students' academic self-perception (P = 0.004). In the present study, all subdomains scored > 2, which means students had positive attitudes toward learning. Conclusion: Although students had positive learning perceptions in all three institutes, there were some problematic areas, such as stress during dental courses, for which policies should be formulated and implemented in dental institutes. The students were found to be too tired at the dental institute; they could not enjoy the program. Student-centered teaching programs can be employed to improve on the weaknesses of institutes. © 2024 Journal of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences University.",

      "Abstract": "Medical image processing is vital for diagnosing and treating diseases, notably using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A prior study introduced an algorithm for MRI image noise reduction, preserving key structures while suppressing mixed noise, though facing challenges in parameter optimization and occasional edge preservation failures. This study proposes a solution, the hybrid cetacean optimization algorithm and Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (COA-SCSO), to enhance MRI image contrast, addressing contrast enhancement limitations in medical image processing. Analyzing cardiac MRI images from SCMR consensus and AMRG Atlas databases, spatial information is emphasized for enhancement. The method integrates a cost function with a contrast measure based on multiple metrics, employing soft-computing approaches to reduce time complexity and expand the search pattern through a spatial domain transformation function. Performance evaluation, incorporating parameters like PSNR, MSE, NAE, and SSIM, shows the proposed algorithm achieving high PSNR (98) and SSIM (0.99) values, and low NAE (-0.17) and MSE (0.16) values compared to existing methods. The COA-SCSO approach demonstrates promising results in MRI image contrast enhancement, with potential implications for medical diagnosis and treatment planning. Further research could explore additional optimization techniques and validate effectiveness on larger datasets for clinical practice. © 2024 ANGIOTHERAPY, a publication of Eman Research, USA.",

      "Abstract": "Introduction: Dental decay is a prevalent oral disease that impacts the quality of life (QoL) of children and adults. However, there is a dearth of information regarding the connection between dental caries and the QoL of adolescents. The study aimed to assess caries prevalence and its association with oral health‑related quality of life (OHRQoL) among adolescents in Modinagar, India. Methods: The present study, conducted on 1600 adolescents, utilized a self‑designed questionnaire to collect demographic data, while the prevalidated Child Perception Questionnaire (CPQ11‑14) assessed OHRQoL. Caries was assessed using the Decayed, Missing, Filled Teeth (DMFT) index. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 27.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27.0. IBM Corp). Results: Dental caries was found to be 38.5% among adolescents. The overall CPQ score was 9.15 ± 0.32. A positive correlation was observed between CPQ and DMFT (rho =0.191, P = 0.002) and also between CPQ and oral symptoms (OS) (rho =0.109, P = 0.0001). Conclusion: Higher CPQ scores indicated a poor OHRQoL. Dental caries exhibited a significant correlation with their OHRQoL. The implementation of an inventive oral healthcare initiative through public‑private collaboration could potentially enhance their OHRQoL. © 2024 Journal of Indian Academy of Oral Medicine & Radiology.",

      "Abstract": "Psidium guajava (Guava) is a commonly cultivated fruit in tropical regions that has been long recognized for its therapeutic applications. The leaves host diverse bioactive compounds, including phenols, flavonoids, terpenoids like gallic acid, and watersoluble tannins. This intricate chemical profile, particularly gallic acid, imparts the leaves with remarkable inhibitory effects against various pathogens, including bacteria and fungi. Compounds such as pyrocatechol, taxifolin, psiguadials, guaijaverin, and avicularin, among others, contribute to their hypoglycemic, antioxidant, anticancer, and antidiarrheal effects, showcasing the leaves' multifaceted therapeutic potential. Apart from having therapeutic potential, guava leaves have also been implicated in adsorbing heavy metals such as zinc, cadmium, arsenic, lead, iron, and chromium, as well as dyes such as methylene blue, congo red, brilliant green, amaranth, auramine, nile blue and photocatalytic dyes from contaminated water sources owing to their porous structure and presence of functional groups. The leaves contain compounds acting as natural coagulants and adsorbents, aiding in flocculation, sedimentation, and removal of impurities. This review aims to provide an overview of the phytochemical profile of guava leaves and further discusses its potential as a therapeutic drug and bioremediation targeting heavy metals and dyes. This eco-friendly approach offers numerous advantages, including affordability, accessibility, and biodegradability, thereby reducing reliance on synthetic adsorbents and promoting sustainability. This amalgamation of traditional medicinal significance with innovative environmental applications underscores the inherent potential of guava leaves as a sustainable and versatile botanical resource. Moreover, the various ongoing studies and the diverse properties of guava discussed herein may serve as a guide for the discovery of new pharmaceutics by the scientific fraternity. © Author (s).",

      "Abstract": "A sensitive and effective method for the detection and enantioseparation of β-blockers was developed. Three quinoline-based active chiral reagents were prepared followed by an amide and ester formation reaction. The synthesized active chiral reagents were characterized with spectroscopic techniques such as NMR, FT-IR, UV, HRMS and elemental analyzer. The active reagents were used in the diastereomerization of the racemic β-blockers (propranolol, metoprolol and carvedilol). Synthesized diastereomeric pairs were then subjected to RP-HPLC for chromatographic separation. The eluting phase, which consists of a buffer solution with acetonitrile, was used for analysis. The separation analysis results were optimized in the presence of variables such as eluting phase ratio, concentration and pH. Additionally, the separation process, elution order and stable conformer of diastereomers were studied by developing minimized energy structures of prepared diastereomeric pairs using DFT. © 2024 Asian Publication Corporation.

      "Abstract": "Solar-based vehicular electrification is bound to play a vital role in Green House Gas (GHG) emission reduction from conventional transports and supporting the fight against environmental degradation. This paper presents the feasibility of solar-based electric vehicle charging (SEVC) in India, a shift of the transportation sector to renewable energy implementation. Solar-electric vehicles may transform the scenario in the coming future in India on a larger scale. Extensive negative environmental impact is produced by transport activities as it pours out 14% of global GHG emissions. The transportation sector is the second major contributor to pollution in India. Currently, dealers of non-renewable resources like coal, petroleum, etc. are facing a tough time meeting increasing demand. This results in limited resources which are being suppressed by the dealers and producers to meet this need which leads us to an insecure future, having scarcity of minerals and fuel. In this paper, we perform a graphical analysis of fuel consumption in India, the growing demand for green transportation in the Indian market and solar potential in our country. In Feb 2023, India’s government revealed the finding of a 5.9 million tons stockpile of unexplored lithium deposits in the Jammu and Kashmir state. So, the price of batteries would be significantly impacted by this, making EVs more accessible to customers. This paper also includes challenges in adopting solar-based transportation, steps of the Indian Government towards green transportation and recommended policies. © 2024 River Publishers.",

      "Abstract": "This article designs a cleaner production scheduling model for defective products with flexible rework rate and shortages by considering the transportation cost as proportional to pandemic intensity. The model incorporates a variable setup cost and carbon emissions originating from various activities, both of which are targeted for reduction through investments in green technologies. The main aim of this work is to determine optimal production strategies for firms operating in emergency situations like pandemics, conflicts, and other unforeseen circumstances. The scenario is mathematically formulated with the objective of minimizing both total cost and overall emissions by optimizing decision variables such as production lot size, backorder, setup cost, and green investment. A numerical example is stated to validate the mathematical formulation, and the discussion of parameter effects on optimal solutions, along with managerial insights, is conducted through sensitivity analysis. © 2024 S.

      "Abstract": "Background: The present cross-sectional study was undertaken to evaluate the periodontal and microbiological parameters in patients with surgically repaired unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) undergoing orthodontic correction in comparison to patients without any cleft or orthodontic treatment. Methods: A total of 120 patients, out of initial 148 patients, between the age group 6 and 18 years were enrolled and divided into four groups with 30 patients each: non-cleft patients without orthodontic treatment in Group 1, non-cleft patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment in Group 2, patients with UCLP without any orthodontic treatment in Group 3, and patients with UCLP undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment in Group 4. Periodontal parameters including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), gingival bleeding index (GBI), community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN) index, pocket probing depth (PD), and tooth mobility were measured in all the groups. The subgingival plaque samples of all the patients were subjected to microbial evaluation using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) for clinical diagnosis. Results: The periodontal parameters were significantly raised in Group 4, followed by Group 3 and Group 2 in comparison to Group 1 (p < 0.01), thereby suggesting poor periodontal health in patients with UCLP undergoing orthodontic treatment. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.01) in counts of micro-organisms among the groups were observed for P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, Veillonella, and Capnocytophaga, with the highest proportions in Group 4, indicating a deteriorating oral health in these patients. Conclusion: Poor periodontal and microbial health in patients with UCLP undergoing orthodontic treatment indicates a need for reinforcement of oral hygiene practices among these patients. © 2024 American Academy of Periodontology.",

      "Abstract": "Recently, researchers have turned their attention to seaweeds. This was because their biological activities had multiple human applications. Chaetomorpha ligustica, Acanthaphora spicifera, Gracilaria edulis, and Gracilaria corticata were some of the seaweeds collected from the coastal fishing village of Olaikuda, Mandapam. Therefore, phytochemical screening meant analyzing the secondary metabolites of seaweeds, which show their medicinal benefits and biological activities. Thirteen different phytochemicals were identified. Four solvents, such as water, hexane, methanol, and chloroform, were used for the extraction of preliminary phytochemical screening. Phytochemical analysis showed that methanol had extracted maximum number of phytochemicals compared to other solvents. TPC (total phenolic content) in obtained extraction seemed to have been high in Acanthaphora spicifera (0.86 ± 0.14 mg GAE g−1), while it was found to be low in Gracilaria edulis (0.53 ± 0.17 mg GAE g−1). The antimicrobial properties of purified polyphenolic substances were assessed against four bacterial and one fungal pathogenic agents. Purified polyphenolic extracts of the selected seaweed were used to measure DPPH radical scavenging, ABTS inhibition, ionic chelate scavenging, phosphomolybdenum assay, and hydroxyl radical scavenging. Chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c, lutein, fucoxanthin, violaxanthin, and β-carotene were identified as major pigments in selected seaweed. Polyphenol compound was analyzed and identified by GC–MS and FTIR. Findings of this research showed that seaweed extract possesses favorable antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, making it suitable for utilization in both food and pharmaceutical industries. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Society for Plant Research 2024.",

      "Abstract": "In this world of software technology, our dependency on software's is increasing continuously. As a result, software industries are working hard to develop highly reliable software and to meet the expectation of customers. Generally, software companies release software early in market to take gain market share, but rigorous software testing is required for early release software to ensure reliability of software and meet the customer's expectations. This requires a huge amount of resources, and it increases financial burden on the company, consequently, decreases the overall profit of company. Further, late release due to prolong testing of a software may improves reliability but results into a loss of market opportunity cost or may not be fulfil the customer's aspirations. As a result, to stay competitive, companies release software early and release patches later to fix the bugs, improve the functionality of software, and to update the software. Software industries are improving the performance or usability of software by releasing patches which may increase the consumption of testing effort and consequently increase in cost. On the other hand, software firms also provide warranty on their products. To address the above said issues, we have developed a testing effort-based software reliability growth model, which incorporates warranty policy and estimates the optimal software release and patch time with the objective to minimise the total testing cost. Further, we have used Genetic Algorithm (GA) to estimate optimum software release and patch time. A numerical illustration has been presented on a real time data set to validate the proposed model. © 2024 River Publishers.",

      "Abstract": "The phenomenon of transformation is seen in almost all aspects of human existence. Industries use technological breakthroughs, such as the incorporation of artificial intelligence and robotics, to improve the overall excellence of their products and services and build operational systems that are more effective and error free. Several organizations are integrating data-driven technology and advanced statistical methodologies into their corporate strategies to get relevant insights from their interactions with existing and potential customers. These technologies may significantly facilitate a satisfactory client experience for companies, particularly in activities such as hotel room or leisure service bookings. The hospitality industry significantly depends on a substantial labor force and emphasizes interpersonal interactions, sometimes referred to as the fundamental aspect of hospitality. However, the advancement of smart cities, smart homes, and smart hotels is leading us toward realizing a technologically advanced world. The proliferation of technological advancements, like the Internet of Things, AI, cloud computing, and big data, has dramatically enhanced the efficiency of work carried out by individuals within the service business. Nevertheless, the rapid advancement of technology is poised to render the service sector devoid of human presence shortly. This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of the importance of interpersonal contact in the context of the tourist and hospitality sector. It also emphasizes using artificial intelligence in the tourist industry in predictive analysis, virtual help for travel experiences, and digital transformation. The tourist and hospitality sectors have seen substantial repercussions due to the recent outbreak of the coronavirus. The chapter finishes by analyzing the impact of AI on the hospitality and tourism business, specifically in terms of its position as a supplementary tool for human resources and its potential to enhance the standard of service and optimize the customer experience. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Park Thaichon, Pushan Kumar Dutta, Pethuru Raj Chelliah and Sachin Gupta; individual chapters, the contributors.",

      "Abstract": "The Indian economy benefits from early disease detection in plant leaves. According to reports, 10-30% of crops suffer harm from diseases that are not discovered during the curing process. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have paved the way for transformative solutions in disease identification for agriculture. This study addresses the critical issue of early disease detection by harnessing the power of deep learning models, specifically CNNs. Different leaf disease detection technologies are used for different crops. The pre-trained deep learning model is used in this study to identify and categorize leaf diseases. A dataset of tomato, potato, and bell pepper leaf pictures from the plant village repository was employed for the current investigation. The developed model can detect 12 plant diseases in normal leaf tissue. The quantitative assessment of our CNN-based technique reveals an impressive accuracy rate of 86.21%. This notable accuracy underscores the efficacy of our approach in the challenging domain of plant disease detection. Our findings show potential for the larger agricultural environment beyond the immediate quantitative advantages. This technical advance not only paves the way for improved crop output and lower losses, but also brings in a new era of data-driven sustainability in agriculture. The bottom line is that our research \"offers a tangible pathway for leveraging AI-powered solutions to address the long-standing challenges of plant disease detection, thereby significantly contributing to the well-being of farmers and the sustenance of the Indian agricultural sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

      "Abstract": "The growing significance of online reviews in e-commerce platforms has a profound impact on consumers' purchase decisions. Unfortunately, dishonest sellers exploit this system by engaging in deceptive practices and manipulating reviews. These fake reviews are very hard to be detected by humans. Hence, the issue of detecting fake online reviews has gained significant attention due to their prevalence. Typically, the datasets available have much higher number of real reviews as compared to fake reviews, which leads to data imbalance problem. Machine learning algorithms struggle to learn from these datasets and give biased results. However, existing studies on this topic have not adequately addressed the challenges posed by imbalanced data. They have mostly used under-sampling or over-sampling to handle imbalance in datasets, which leads to potential information loss or overfitting due to replication. Hence, to handle this class imbalance problem without using sampling techniques, this paper proposes a novel SBiLM model using Siamese Neural Network with Bidirectional LSTM and Manhattan Distance. SBiLM takes pair of reviews as inputs and computes similarity between them using distance metric. The outcomes indicate that the SBiLM model exhibits better performance in terms of both accuracy and loss, when compared with traditional deep learning models on a highly imbalanced restaurant review dataset. This presents a promising strategy for tackling the issues related to data imbalance in the domain of fake review detection. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "Conventional preprocessing methods in medical imaging can effectively reduce the combination of Gaussian and Impulsive noise, while still maintaining the crucial features such as edges within the images. However, these techniques are found to lag in the optimizing the certain image parameters which play a crucial rule in enhancing the input images and thus may lead to failing in preserving the edges that may adversely affect the early diagnosis of diseases. An attempt has been made to enhance the contrast of cardiac MR (Medical Resonance) images using Cetacean Optimization Algorithm (COA) for improving disease diagnosis. Input cardiac images have been acquired from the free online available databases viz., SCMR consensus and AMRG Atlas. The methodology includes integration of the cost function with contrast measure based on certain metrics to create a newer transformation function. It results in enhanced search pattern using a transformation function in spatial domain and improves the pixel intensity to increase the resolution of an image. The developed algorithm's performance was evaluated by computing various parameters including peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measurement (SSIM), mean square error (MSE), and normalized absolute error (NAE). Analysis of the results reveals that the proposed method achieves the highest PSNR (72 dB) and SSIM (0.99) values, along with the lowest NAE (0.16%) and MSE (0.22%) compared to both the particle swarm optimized texture-based histogram equalization (PSOTHE) method and the modified sunflower optimization (MSFO) method. The results indicate that the suggested strategy might improve the intricate details of the input cardiac MRI images. This enhancement can contribute to the efficient identification of cardiac disorder-specific biomarkers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "Background: Persistent neck pain is a prevalent musculoskeletal condition that affects the quality of life and functional abilities of individuals. Blood Flow Restriction Training (BFRT) is a novel therapeutic approach that involves restricting blood flow to exercising muscles to enhance strength and function. However, limited research has been conducted on the effects of BFRT on pressure pain threshold and hand function in adults with persistent neck pain. This randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the potential benefits of BFRT as a treatment intervention for this population. Methods: This study will be a prospective 1:1 allocation, parallel group active controlled trail conducted at Physiotherapy Department, Galgotias University. The trial was prospectively registered with the Clinical Trial Registry India CTRI/2023/06/053439. Informed consent will be obtained from all the participants who are eligible to be included in the study. A total of 110 patients with persistent neck pain will be randomly allocated into two groups. The BFRT group will receive supervised training sessions three times a week for eight weeks, performing low-load resistance exercises with blood flow restriction applied using personalized cuff pressure. The control group will receive standard care for neck pain, which may include general advice, manual therapy, and/or home exercises without BFRT. The primary outcome measures will be the pressure pain threshold, assessed using a pressure Algometer, and hand function, evaluated using standardized tests such as Hand Grip Strength and Purdue Peg board Test. Results: The data obtained will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, and the significance level will be set at p<0.05. Conclusion: This trial will contribute valuable contribution highlighting the potential benefits of BFR training in improving pressure pain threshold and hand function in adults with persistent neck pain.

      "Abstract": "Aim: To evaluate and compare the fracture resistance of endodontically treated maxillary teeth using the same material as indirect and direct composite onlays and their modes of fracture. Methods: Ninety maxillary premolars were divided into six groups (n = 15) out of which 15 teeth were kept intact (negative control, Group 1). In the remaining 75 teeth, endodontic treatment was done and standardized mesio-occlusal-distal cavities were prepared. Fifteen teeth were kept unrestored (positive control, Group 2). The rest of the teeth were divided according to the type of restorations and the restorative material; Group 3: Ceram X sphereTEC™ one direct composite onlay, Group 4: Ceram X sphereTEC™ one indirect composite onlay, Group 5: Filtek Z 350 XT direct composite onlay, and Group 6: Filtek Z 350 XT indirect composite onlay. All the specimens were subjected to thermocycling and cyclic loading. The fracture resistance test was performed with the help of a universal testing machine and their modes of fracture were evaluated. Results: Mean fracture resistance values in the decreasing order are as: 1487.33N for Group 6, 1104.57N for Group 4, 933.87N for Group 1, 799.13N for Group 5, and 688.73N for Group 3, 265.23N for Group 2. Mean fracture resistance of Groups 6 and 4 was found to be significantly higher than Groups 1, 2, 3, and 5. Furthermore, there was a significant difference between Groups 1 and 3. Groups 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 showed more number of favorable/restorable fractures, whereas Group 2 showed more unfavorable/unrestorable fracture. Conclusion: The indirect technique of fabrication of onlays improved the fracture resistance of endodontically treated maxillary premolars. © 2024 Endodontology.",

      "Abstract": "In past few decades, the necessity of deep learning algorithms has strengthened the concept and applications of computer vision. The concept of deep learning is based on the application of algorithms of artificial neural networks (ANN) that has a capability of mimicking the neurons of the human brain. In the early 2000s, the performance of computer systems was accelerated with the help of GPUs, commonly known as graphing processing units, giving an objective to explore more research in the domain of abilities of computer ANNs. With the help of prevailing IoT devices, educationalists and researchers received large and diverse access to the libraries of almost any type of digital data for its application in deep learning and thus many engineering applications. The development of deep neural networks (DNNs) and conventional neural networks (CNNs) is the foundational base of the application of deep leaning in computer vision. With applications in facial recognition and image classification, the algorithms of deep learning exceed its human counterparts. This chapter will be focusing on the inter-blending applications of deep learning and computer vision and how it has broadened the domain of augmented intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT). © 2024 CRC Press.",

      "Abstract": "Advancements in technology and modernisation result in a convenient and smart living environmental ecosystem, including smart cities and smart infrastructure, with the amalgamation of the concept of Internet of Things (IoT), collected data and internet-based services and systems over different communication procedures. IoT is considered the next generation of internet services. However, general resource-constrained IoT-enabled devices, which are capable of performing a specific task, impose fresh security challenges, unauthorised access to data, node forgery and denial of services. Also, these devices are more vulnerable to being compromised by opponents compared to basic computing devices and are exposed to various types of attacks such as botnet and spoofing attacks. One of the most promising approaches for providing improvement in the security of networks lies in identification of devices. The devices identified for applications in IoT-based communication systems can be classified under two categories, explicit identifiers and implicit identifiers. Internet protocol or media access control addresses fall under the category of explicit identifiers, whereas radio signal features and network trafficking come under implicit identifiers, with the latter being more secure, robust and reliable for many IoT applications. This chapter deals with the various communication devices available on the market for performing IoT services, progressing towards a smarter society by adapting and adopting the new technological approaches in the design and configuration of IoT devices. © 2024, CRC PRESS..",

      "Abstract": "A series of test experimental analyses have been performed to analyze the performance parameters of CI engine fueled with diesel and biodiesel blends. The various biodiesel blends have been prepared as K0L20D80, K5L15D80, K10L10D80, K15L5D80, and K20L0D80 with the combination of Karanja and Linseed biodiesel along with diesel. The results indicate that the performance parameters of blends have been given adjacent results to diesel. A higher concentration of Karanja oil as compared to linseed oil in diesel blends has given better results for performance parameters. The results demonstrated that K15L5D80 gives better results compared to all other blends and is close to diesel for the performance parameters of CI engine. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "In the realm of healthcare, big data plays a crucial role by providing the necessary data for deep learning algorithms. This data, collected from various IoT devices, is stored in the cloud and used to improve healthcare services. The security of this sensitive health-related information is facilitated by big data security frameworks that automate security evaluation and analysis. Big data operations now use cloud deployment designs as their preferred computing model. This development was driven by the scalability, flexibility, and affordability of these solutions. These characteristics make it an extreme challenge for healthcare organisations using traditional data management mechanisms to store and process these huge datasets. Under a deployment approach like this, the user no longer maintains the data physically, which causes security issues. In this situation, the taking up of cloud architectures is majorly facilitated by big data security. Big data is based on an automated framework for security evaluation and an approach to security analysis. This framework makes the design phase, mapping of the big data, and cloud security best practices. As a result of this, the security design time is reduced, and the knowledge of security parameters is raised. The framework’s advantages and disadvantages are reviewed thoroughly, and the existing and ongoing problems in the big data and cloud-related field are highlighted. Working with big data in the cloud presents a unique difficulty of balancing two incompatible design tenets. Big data systems (like Hadoop) are founded on the share-nothing principle, where each node is independent and self-sufficient, but cloud computing is focused on the notions of consolidation and resource sharing. This chapter provides an overview of the big data idea; examines relevant mathematical and data analytics methods; and provides a taxonomy of the current tools, frameworks, and platforms for various big data computing models. © 2024 CRC Press.",

      "Abstract": "Geospatial technologies have emerged as an enormous and powerful domain of emerging technologies in the present era due to continuous advancements in the applications of different analytical tools in gathering of data and computations for their utilisation in multi-disciplinary fields. The complexity of well-being and health of humankind necessitate a robust system with analytical competence, which is easily provided by present-day geospatial tools. In contrast to understanding the definition of human wellbeing and healthcare theoretically, the technological advancements in machinery and medicine are a hands-on matter practically. The maximum benefits of both the domains still cannot be attained, besides building a meaningful bridge between the same. Geospatial technologies are playing a vital role in bridging the gap between these domains and thus helping in the overall healthcare systems of society. In the past three decades, incredible technological advancements have been experienced in the application of geospatial technologies in healthcare systems, but there are still some limitations to rectify. The limitations mostly focus upon the availability and application of geospatial-based spatial analytical tools. This chapter will be dealing with the application of geospatial technologies in current healthcare systems, highlighting the emerging technologies making the path easier for broader application areas. © 2024 CRC Press.",

      "Abstract": "Micro- and nano-plastics (MNPs) are ubiquitous emerging pollutants that have gained global traction due to their persistent nature and potential risks to the environment and human health. The physico-chemical properties of MNPs such as size, shape, density, surface charge and hydrophobicity are quite different from macro-plastics, which render them unique behavior exemplified by high rate of diffusion, high mobility, easy uptake by organisms, high toxicity, and potential of bioaccumulation. Human exposure to MNPs causes serious health impacts including apoptosis, necrosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic disorders, and hampered immune responses. The hazardous nature and high persistence of MNPs in the environment necessitates accelerated studies focused upon their detection, quantification, impact analysis, and risk assessment. All kinds of wastewaters whether municipal, agricultural, or industrial, consist of significant loads of MNPs and act as secondary source of MNP pollution in groundwater and soil. Wastewater is highly complex in composition and there are several impediments in the accurate detection and identification of MNPs in this matrix owing to the in-efficient sampling methods, lack of standardized methodologies, and non-reproducibility of data. This review provides an overview of currently available techniques for sampling, detection, identification, and characterization of MNPs in wastewater. A critical commentary on the challenges and limitations of these techniques has been given and strategic combinatorial methods have been suggested for efficient and reliable MNP analysis in wastewater samples. The article also highlights novel sensor-based methods enabling rapid and accurate detection of MNPs in wastewater. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

      "Abstract": "Efficient energy management is crucial given 2024's 4.1% worldwide electricity demand increase. This urgency emphasizes the necessity for various, sustainable energy sources in distribution grids. Short-term load prediction approaches using probabilistic power generation and energy storage are crucial for energy usage prediction. Urban energy planners use simulation, probability optimization and modelling to create sustainable energy systems. This study offers a novel hybrid model for smart grids: short-term energy load prediction using transfer learning (TL) and optimized lightGBM (OLGBM). Our two-phase solution tackles Short-term Load Forecasting complexities. First, aberrant supplements and quick deviation selection eliminate missing values and identify key features during data pre-processing. Second, TL-OLGBM learns dynamic time scales and complex data patterns with Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters to improve forecasting accuracy. Additionally, our architecture easily combines the newest Smart and Green Technology, enabling energy system innovation. Comparative performance research shows that our technique outperforms similar models in mean absolute percentage error, accuracy and root mean square error. This hybrid model is a reliable short-term energy load forecast solution that fits the dynamic terrain of smart and green technology integration in modern energy systems. © The Author(s) 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Several Indian government initiatives have been started to create awareness and bring health consciousness among its citizens. Over the years traditional models of business have been replaced by adoption of digital technologies and platforms such as mobile applications across many organisations due to technological advancements [1]. Different Missions and various apps are included in such government initiatives. The current study aims to determine the characteristics of government eHealth service users and nonusers and examine the distinctions between the two. The present research presents a typology of Urban Indian citizens. Perception and attitude toward the usefulness of such government eHealth missions and services are studied through structured questionnaires. The researchers found seven distinct groups after a cluster analysis of 187 responses. Dimensionality reduction techniques preceded cluster analysis. The compilation of results suggests no consistent pattern, as a limited number of people have adopted such initiatives. Reluctance and lack of trust in these platforms and apps are significant hindrances limiting their utilization and adoption by Indian citizens. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "Over the decades classical and molecular cytogenetics have played an immense role in the field of crop improvement. Chromosome research on germplasms has aided crop improvement, conservation, and the use of plant genetic resources. There was no agreement on chromosome morphology and chromatin length throughout the 1952–1991 era when chromosomal research on Indian lentils was conducted by various authors using orcein squash procedures. The enzymatic maceration and air drying (EMA) based Giemsa staining techniques were performed through thorough and comparative chromosomal analysis on two wild and cultivated cultivars. The many results of chromosomal research showed chromosomal stability, a consistent karyotype formula (3 m + 1 m (sat) + 2 sm + 1 st), one pair of interstitial sat on either chromosome 3 or 4, and noteworthy variations in total chromatin length (53.6–121.2 m) in studied cultivars. Critical evaluation of more than seven decades of chromosomal information has revealed unique karyotype diversity within the landraces of different countries. The application of fluorescent banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) has helped to segregate cultivars based on cultivar-specific chromosomal markers and landmarks. Selection of cultivated and wild cultivars based on qualitative and disease-related morpho-traits and new information from this critical review, especially on molecular cytogenetics may provide more options for crop improvement. More research in the field of molecular cytogenetics from country-specific species and cultivars is needed to enrich the repository of the gene pool. Alien gene introgression from an extended gene pool through advanced genomics and biotechnological tools could facilitate the path of sustainable improvement of this crop. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract": "Aim: Comparing the effectiveness of third-generation light-emitting diode light-curing devices and their impact on bulk-fill composites is the primary purpose of this study. Materials and Methods: In vitro investigation was carried out on a total of 32 samples of two bulk-fill composites. Four groups (n = 8) were formed. Half of the specimens of Tetric® N-Ceram Bulk Fill and Palfique Bulk Flow composites were randomly selected and cured from top with Bluephase® N LED light curing unit (LCU), and the remaining half with FlashMax P3 WS 4W LED LCU, following instructions provided by the manufacturer. The samples were assessed for degree of conversion (DoC) and microhardness after being submerged in distilled water solution and kept in an incubator for 24 h at 37°C. The two LED LCUs were compared. Standard deviation and mean were used to describe the data. Utilizing the Kruskal–Wallis test, the groups were compared. The independent sample t test was used to evaluate the differences in values between the top and bottom surfaces, and the Bonferroni post hoc test was used for multiple comparisons. The DoC and microhardness were correlated, and this was evaluated using Pearson’s correlation test. Results: The mean values for both parameters were statistically different when the two composites were cured with the LED-LCUs. Both the bulk-fill composites showed better mechanical properties when cured with Bluephase N® LED-LCU. Conclusions: Bluephase N® LED-LCU showed better performance than FlashMax P3 WS 4W. The bulk-fill composites showed significant differences in both parameters when cured with the two LED-LCUs. © 2024 Journal of International Oral Health | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",

      "Abstract": "In this paper, we will examine numerous optimization approaches in the field of computer science engineering in depth, shedding light on their applications, strengths, and weaknesses. Optimization algorithms are important tools in computer science engineering, with applications spanning from machine learning to computer vision, data mining, robotics, and more. In principle, optimization algorithms strive to locate the best possible solution among a group of possibilities while taking certain objectives and restrictions into account. They are the foundation of problem-solving approaches, providing a systematic and efficient approach to dealing with multiple difficulties. The efficiency and efficacy of each algorithm vary from one another, and each algorithm has advantages and limits that rely on the applications they are used with. We intend to provide a comprehensive view of optimization algorithms. We will cover their many types, delving into their real-world applications and painstakingly analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, we will investigate the complexities of each algorithm, giving light on the specific characteristics and settings in which they shine. This work seeks to serve as a basic resource for computer science engineering academics and practitioners, developing a deeper understanding of optimization algorithms and stimulating more inquiry in this dynamic field. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Background: Nitric oxide, a diatomic free radical activated by phagocytic leukocytes, arginine a catalyzed product that is synthesized by nitric oxide synthases. It is one of the mechanisms which assists in the resolution of inflammation. A review of its effect on healing around dental implants is yet to be studied. Objective: To review the role of nitric oxide on healing around dental implants. Material and methods: A digital search was carried out using Google Scholar, Medline, and PubMed. The most related article was selected for the review. Conclusion: Osseointegration of dental implants is inclined by many factors which affect the bone-implant contact formation process, and it initiates by forming a hematoma, immunomodulation, and angiogenesis following osteogenesis. Nitric oxide shows a biphasic effect on osteoblast and osteoclast activity, which depends on the concentration of nitric oxide and it can be an important factor in achieving successful osseointegration. © The Author(s).",

      "Abstract": "This chapter helps you to study the 6D printing idea with 3D additive printing and is increased by the addition of two axes, supplied by a mobile printer bed that moves back and forth as needed. It is possible to print objects from any angle with 3D printer heads, as opposed to just from above, as is the case with all regular 3D printers. This opens up a broader range of printing options, not simply in terms of the overall form of a completed product. By design, objects manufactured using conventional 3D printers that use the layer-upon-layer technique of printing may not necessarily have a high degree of structural integrity. When these items are subject to particular circumstances, their weak areas become obvious, and the things collapse or shatter as a result of their construction. 5D printers, on the other hand, enable designers to account for anticipated pressures and build a stronger product since the material is put down from numerous angles rather than just layered on top of one another, eliminating weak places. In addition, 5D printing may remove the sometimes-required chore of “cleaning up” an item after it has been created. In certain circumstances, things produced by a 3D basic printer must be manufactured with support parts or other appendices left in place by accessing the 3D printer head top-down. It is not necessary to create the appendages since 6D printer heads approach the item from numerous angles, so saving both time and material. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Saumya Shah, Hemant Nautiyal, Gaurav Gugliani, Ashwani Kumar, Tanuj Namboodri and Yogesh Kumar Singla; individual chapters, the contributors.",

      "Abstract": "Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is a growing concern as the global population continues to age. It is associated with physical disability, decreased quality of life, and increased risk of falls and fractures. Nutritional interventions have been suggested to be effective in the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. According to cross-sectional studies, the prevalence of sarcopenia in people with heart failure (HF) is 38% for men and 32% for women, contributing to cardiac fragility, a lower quality of life, and an increased risk of death. A rising number of research studies have been performed to investigate the role of certain nutrients on muscle mass or function, as appropriate nutrition is crucial for muscle maintenance. The goal of this systematic review is to outline the present evidence for exercise and nutritional interventions as potential contributors to the treatment of sarcopenia and frailty (decreased muscle mass and physical function), as well as the threat of underlying cardiac metabolic comorbidity in individuals who have heart failure (HF), cancer, CVDs, and other health problems. The biochemical properties of natural foods play a crucial role in the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. This review explores the effectiveness of nutritional interventions for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. © 2024 Shivangi Srivastava et al.",

      "Abstract": "In our daily lives, individuals face countless choices across different aspects. Many a times these decisions are made based on a number of factors, some of which are obvious, whereas some of them are vague and not precise. These can result in facing certain challenges while making decisions. To handle such situations Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques have been developed. The aim of this article is to suggest a method to rank and hence choose a university for students’ admission using the method Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS). To achieve the goal a novel distance measure has been proposed, and some axiomatic properties have also been proved for the same. The proposed approach aids in the process of university selection by ranking the universities based on certain criteria in fuzzy environment. The results obtained suggest that the proposed model provides a accurate way to select the best university among the large number of choices available for the considered universities. The paper settles with a discussion of a case study and experimental findings. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Objective: Evaluate facial changes after Presurgical Naso-Alveolar Molding (PNAM) in unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) patients treated with Modified Grayson Technique and AlignerNAM (with DynaCleft nasal elevator) using a 3D facial scan. Design: Randomised clinical trial. Setting: Institutional study. Participants: 20 UCLP patients allocated to two groups (10 patients each). Interventions: Group A patients underwent PNAM with Modified Grayson Technique and Group B patients underwent AlignerNAM (with DynaCleft nasal elevator). Their 3D facial scans were obtained by using an iOSbased application (Bellus3D FaceApp) mounted on a novel frame. These.stl files were analysed using 3D software (GOM INSPECT) at three-time intervals; before intervention (T0), after intervention (T1) and one month after lip repair surgery (T2). Main Outcome Measure(s): Changes in facial and nasolabial morphology. Results: Both techniques brought significant improvement in the columellar length, nasal tip projection, columella angle, nasal tip angle and a significant reduction in cleft width. At T1, a statistically significant difference in angular and linear measurements was present in both groups. At T2, no statistically significant difference in linear parameters was observed between the two groups except for the outer lateral height of the non-cleft side, basal lateral height of the non-cleft side, and philtrum width. Similar pattern was observed in angular measurements with no statistically significant difference between the two groups except in nasolabial angle, anterior nasal base triangle III, and anterior nasal root triangle. Conclusions: Aligner NAM and Modified Grayson technique are equally effective PNAM methods with similar clinical results in nasolabial morphology after lip repair surgery. © 2024, American Cleft Palate Craniofacial Association.",

      "Abstract": "Biopolymers and sustainable biopolymers-based composites are derived from renewable biomass sources, such as starch, cellulose, and proteins. The fabrication processes involve chemical and enzymatic reactions to produce biodegradable and compostable materials with diverse mechanical and thermal properties. As eco-friendly substitutes for petroleum-based plastics, these materials play a pivotal role in reducing environmental impact and fostering sustainable development. Despite their green credentials, biopolymers and their composites are susceptible to failures during their lifecycle. Mechanical, environmental, and thermal failures can occur due to excessive stress, exposure to moisture and sunlight, and temperature fluctuations, respectively. Understanding these failure mechanisms is vital to improve the durability and reliability of these materials. To address failures and extend the service life of biopolymers-based composites, various repairing techniques are being explored. Adhesive-based approaches using eco-friendly bio-adhesives have shown promise in fixing small-scale damages like cracks and punctures. Additionally, heat-based methods, such as hot-pressing or welding, are effective for repairing larger defects in specific biopolymer composites. Ongoing research is also focused on developing innovative strategies, including self-healing materials and chemical recycling techniques, to further enhance the repairing and recycling processes. In conclusion, biopolymers and sustainable biopolymers-based composites offer a greener and more sustainable solution to the plastic pollution problem. Their fabrication from renewable resources and potential for repair and recycling make them promising candidates for various applications across industries, contributing to a more sustainable and eco-friendly future. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Vikas Dhawan, Atul Babbar, Inderdeep Singh, and Jonathan M.

The study reviews relevant literature on CNTs, epoxy composites, and their mechanical characteristics. The challenges of various old and new machining processes are explored, with issues such as tool wear, surface integrity, and heat impacts being particularly problematic. The experimental setup involves preparing CNT-reinforced epoxy composite samples and using specialized machining equipment. Experimentation is conducted to determine the best combination of cutting settings, cooling methods, and lubrication strategies for a given machining task. The results demonstrate that machining settings influence material removal rates, surface quality, and mechanical characteristics of the composites. Understanding the microstructure of a material contributes to better grasping its machinability. In summary, this work provides essential knowledge on machining CNT-reinforced epoxy composites, enabling further investigation in this area and facilitating the efficient use of these cutting-edge materials in various technical domains. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Vikas Dhawan, Atul Babbar, Inderdeep Singh, and Jonathan M.

      "Abstract": "The research paper aims to elucidate the current state of air pollution in automobile emissions within the contemporary industrial landscape, considering factors such as time-series data on road, maritime, and air traffic, along with meteorological records primarily obtained from Open Data sources. In this study, the researchers introduce a model designed to estimate the contributions to air pollution from automobile emissions using artificial intelligence and modern machine learning techniques. Conventional pollutant dispersion models often face limitations due to incomplete descriptions of atmospheric boundary layer hydrodynamics, partial characterizations of emission inventories, and, in many instances, high computational costs. Additionally, the paper delves into the technologies underpinning the use of modes and mediums which causes less pollution like use of green technology in transportation. Furthermore, there is an attempt to align the development of electric vehicles with machine learning, highlighting their substantial role in diminishing the graph of air pollution. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the term used to describe the intelligence exhibited by machines, allowing them to perform tasks efficiently. AI has brought about a revolution in the field of speech recognition, enabling machines to comprehend and interpret human speech with an impressive degree of accuracy. Speech recognition is the process of a computer understanding and responding to voice input for various tasks. AI is built upon two fundamental principles. Firstly, it involves studying human thought processes, and secondly, it entails representing and simulating these processes through machines, such as computers and robots. One of the primary advantages of a speech recognition system is its ability to allow users to multitask. Users can focus on observations and manual tasks while controlling machinery through voice commands. Speech signal classification is a challenging yet pivotal task in the field of signal processing and machine learning. This study investigates the potential of neural networks as formidable models for this purpose, emphasizing the influence of pre- processing techniques on their performance. Our findings highlight the proficiency of even simplified neural network models in recognizing a limited set of words, showcasing their versatility in speech-related tasks © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "This paper deals with a grid connected PV system having LCL filter. The key emphasis is given to the two optimisation methods – grey wolf optimisation (GWO) and genetic algorithm (GA) which are used to optimise proportional-integral (PI) controller parameters. The GWO and GA are used to determine the optimal values of the PI controller parameters, Kp and Ki in real time operation. The main objective is to reduce the transient response, minimise time overshoot, and to obtain low steady state error. The LCL filter has excellent harmonic suppression capability compared to L and LC filters and used to suppress the harmonics introduced by PWM techniques. The simulation results have been analysed under grid-side load variation and during LLG, LLLG, and LG faults conditions. The comparative simulation results indicate that transient stability of grid-connected PV system using GWO and GA shows better response than conventional PI controller. © 2024 Inderscience Publishers.

      "Abstract": "Obesity has reached alarming proportions globally, with an estimated 1.9 billion adults classified as overweight and 650 million as obese. This health epidemic results in approximately 2.8 million annual deaths due to obesity-related complications. Women are more vulnerable to facing the adverse effects of being overweight. Consequently, Researchers are actively exploring various strategies for obesity prevention. One such strategy gaining significant attention is the key role of breakfast consumption in preventing obesity. Recent research has focused on examining the impact of breakfast on energy balance and weight regulation. This comprehensive review aims to evaluate current research on the relationship between breakfast intake and obesity prevention. The data for this review was acquired from a variety of sources such as Google Scholar, Research Gate, PubMed, and Science Direct, and was authored by a variety of researchers. The findings of this review underscore a growing consensus regarding the role of breakfast consumption in the prevention of obesity. Physiological and behavioural mechanisms suggest that regular breakfast consumption can exert a positive influence on weight management. Skipping breakfast has been associated with unusual metabolic effects, obesity-related type 2 diabetes, heart disease, as well as disruption to circadian rhythms. In light of these findings, it becomes apparent that embracing a nutrient-rich breakfast, adhering to regular meal timings, and implementing behaviour change strategies may prove helpful in preventing obesity and obesity-related health issues. Nevertheless, to establish a definitive causal relationship, further research is imperative, including well-designed randomized controlled trials. © 2024 JK Practitioner. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "Renewable energy is becoming one of the sustainability solutions for the future energy demand and regarding the industries, it is going to be mandatory for a long-term solution. Although grids are becoming healthier day by day and the World is moving towards Zero Carbon emissions. Most industries are running on fossil fuel Gensets, which is not an economical nor a long-term solution. In INDIA State Governments are encouraging and imposing PV Solar installation in industries to overcome the energy crisis in the coming times, as grids are becoming day by day more heavily loaded. A recent survey shows that Delhi is now the most polluted city in India resulting in the closing of all the thermal and gas power generation stations as they were creating pollution. To overcome this situation Grids, play a very important role as they are a single source to feed energy to industries, so to make the grid more powerful sustainable renewable energy sources need to be added as much as possible. During daytime energy demand is higher and PV solar is the best solution to meet this demand, industries need to take initiatives in this regard. The rooftop is the best location for any industry to install PV as the roof is the most ignored and underutilized space. With the help of PVSYS and STAAD software, we can find out the exact requirement and capacity of the structure to handle 170km/hr of wind pressure and also the dynamic load of the PV module. Capacity is calculated based on space available on the roof. The work represents a case study of with the whole project's specifications. Identify the power quality problem that was noticed right after installation and the techniques of mitigation that were implemented in order to improve the system's PQ. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "Many phytochemicals and their derived metabolites produced by plants are extensively employed in commercial goods, pharmaceutical products as well as in the environmental and medical fields. However, these secondary metabolites obtained from plants are in low amounts, and it is difficult to synthesize them at the industrial level. Despite these challenges, they may be utilized for a variety of medicinal products that are either available in the market or are being researched and tested. Secondary metabolites are complex compounds that exhibit chirality. Further, under controlled conditions with elicitors, desired secondary metabolites may be produced from plant cell cultures. This review emphasizes the various aspects of secondary metabolites including their types, synthesis, and applications as medicinal products.

      "Abstract": "A crucial component of an autonomous vehicle's architecture is its ability to handle emergency scenarios. An automated collision avoidance controller is created using a cautious approach that takes into account the minimum amount of tire-road friction necessary to make the maneuver possible. This paper presents the concept of a collision avoidance (CA) scheme by controlling speed of vehicle and distance from other vehicle and sides. It proposes vehicular compatibility-based cooperative communications between two vehicles which extends the network access. Drivers' responses and behaviours vary greatly depending on which assistance technology is used in response to which hazard. This highlights the need for adaptive automation that can reconcile the system's and humans' processing capacities with the potentially dangerous situations that arise. The performance is measured in terms of distance, velocity and angle of rotation of vehicle. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "This research aims to tackle traffic congestion at intersections, primarily caused by static traffic light timings that don't adapt to changing traffic conditions. The proposed solution involves using adaptive fuzzy controllers, which can adjust their decisions based on fuzzy IF-THEN rules. These controllers employ both Mamdani and Sugeno fuzzy logic. The Mamdani method considers factors like the number of vehicles, queue length, emergency vehicle access, and road width to optimize traffic light timings and reduce unnecessary green signals. The Sugeno-type fuzzy logic enhances controller efficiency and decreases waiting times. The study also explores the application of direct adaptive fuzzy controllers to manage unstable systems, which is relevant in optimizing traffic control. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a simulator capable of predicting the right traffic light timings in real-time. This involves extending green light timings for lanes with high vehicle volumes and also for the emergency vehicles to alleviate congestion at intersections. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "Deforestation is a significant global problem that has detrimental impacts on society, the economy, and the environment. In order to determine how to reduce deforestation, it is important to comprehend its basic causes and how they impact every aspect of the globe. The present paper will discuss the existing techniques of image classification and provide insights into new methods and tools that can be used for classifying images. The paper will also illustrate the potential challenges, such as data accessibility, data quality, and algorithmic bias that arise when using these categories to stop deforestation. The paper proposes a zone labeling model to prevent deforestation using image classification techniques. Towards the end of the paper future directions including new algorithms and sensors have been discussed. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "Alzheimer’s Disease constitutes one of the biggest portions of the diseases related to ageing. Mild Cognitive Impairment may be considered the formative stage of this disease. The automated diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment using Machine Learning will help the clinicians in delaying its progression and will be easy, cheap, and efficient for the patient. This work uses neuropsychological data obtained from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), containing the results from 12 tests including Mini-Mental State Examination and ADAS-Cog. An extensive empirical analysis is carried out and the most important features are extracted using the proposed pipelines. The Feature Selection is done using both filter and wrapper methods and in total 13 features were selected. It was found that most of the selected features related to tasks associated with memory. The proposed method gives a performance of 0.9817 in terms of F1 Score. Thus, performing better vis-à-vis the state of the art. The proposed pipeline helps to reduce the number of neuropsychological tests to diagnose the disease. This work is one of the components of the projects that use multi-modality data including structural-Magnetic Resonance Imaging, functional-Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography and Neuropsychological data to develop a system for efficient and effective diagnosis of MCI. The project management is done using Agile Methodology. The results are encouraging and pave the way for the development of such a system. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Farm ponds are traditional water harvesting structures to capture surface runoff and utilize this stored rainwater during the lean periods for agriculture. Benefits of the farm ponds include improvement in land productivity, supplemental irrigation to crops, reduced water logging in high rainfall events, and fish culture when sufficient water is available. Farm ponds are becoming increasingly popular in India as water storage tanks or reservoirs, designed for harvesting rainwater on agricultural land. The Maharashtra State Government as well as Central Government have been promoting Farm Pond through various schemes with the provision of subsidies. The farm ponds in Maharashtra are becoming popular after the government subsidy was made available. The present study dwells into the rapid rise in farm pond numbers and how they are impacting the precious groundwater resources in the drought-prone Ahmednagar district. of Maharashtra. The density of farm ponds in Sangamner Taluka of the district is very high, and so is groundwater extraction. Study indicates that multiple sources of water are used to fill the farm ponds, with borewells and dug wells accounting for the bulk of the supply. In order to decipher the vagaries in the Electrical Conductivity (EC) trend and eventually demarcating the zone of influence, the physio-chemical parameters were assessed to speculate on solid dilution from pumping well to surrounding non-pumping wells. Moreover, the artificial recharge zone maps prepared by Groundwater Survey and Development Agency, Govt. of Maharashtra, were utilized to understand how the farm ponds, often lined are faultily located in recharge zones, blocking the recharge. The practice of using farm ponds as storage tanks for pumped-out groundwater has imposed a negative impact on the surrounding groundwater wells that leads to inequality among the different categories of water users in villages. It is important to relook into the policy and practice of farm ponds for sustainable use of groundwater resources in this drought-prone stretch of Maharashtra. © Centre for Science and Technology of the Non-aligned and Other Developing Countries (NAM S&T Centre) 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Depression negatively affects the daily life of an individual and may even lead to suicidal tendencies. The problem is compounded by the scarcity of trained psychologists and psychiatrists in developing countries due to which many cases go undetected. The automated diagnosis of depression can, therefore, assist clinicians to screen the patients and help them to handle the symptoms. The advent of wearable devices in the past decade has helped in capturing signals, which can be used to diagnose depression. This work uses a publicly available dataset and develops a model based on the distribution of microstructures from the temporal data to accomplish the given task. The results are encouraging and better than the state-of-the-art. An accuracy of 86.90% is obtained by using the proposed pipeline.

      "Abstract": "High-performance concrete known as self-compacting concrete (SSC) may flow effortlessly under its own weight without the use of mechanical vibration. Due to its excellent qualities, including filling formwork and self-consolidating, it is frequently used in construction. The study's objective is to determine the ideal chemical admixture percentages for composite SSC. 40% of GGBS, 30% of GGBS, 20% of GGBS and FA, 15% of GGBS and FA, 40% of FA, and 30% of FA were replaced for various amounts of GGBS, FA, and cement. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) SSC was examined for strength, flexural, and split tensile strength behaviours at various ages for varied cement replacement amounts, and the outcomes were compared to conventional SSC (100% cement). Armix-HyyeCrete PC 20 super plasticizer has been utilized to ensure workability while maintaining a steady water-binder ratio. To improve strength and durability, the paper's conclusion emphasized the significance of determining the ideal amount of chemical admixture in composite SSC. Doing so might potentially lower the cost of SCC and make it more commercially feasible for usage in construction. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Urban waterlogging and groundwater depletion are two diverse but major challenges of Indian cities under changing climatic conditions. The enhanced extreme events of rainfall in recent years along with rapidly altered hydrological conditions in the urban environment pose a conducive situation for urban waterlogging. On the other hand, intense and large withdrawal of groundwater, higher than the natural annual recharge has depleted the groundwater level severely in many Indian cities. A pilot project is executed in Faridabad Smart City of National Capital Region India, to combat waterlogging and also to rejuvenate groundwater resourceGroundwater resource. In the study, all steps were undertaken meticulously, beginning with hydrogeological study, site selection, rainfall analysis, calculations of runoff generation, framing well design after identification of suitable recharge zones within depleted aquiferAquifers”, and determination of its intake capacity. It further elucidates the estimation of the suitable dimension of the desilting chamber, fixing a suitable dose of ferric chloride for coagulation, and assessment of recharge volume. The constructed recharge system is tested whether it is working effectively as per the feedback obtained from independent sources. It has high scalability in similar hydrogeological situations in other parts of India. © Centre for Science and Technology of the Non-aligned and Other Developing Countries (NAM S&T Centre) 2024.",

      "Abstract": "One of the major diseases found in women worldwide is Breast Cancer. More than 2.2M cases have been reported with about a 30% mortality rate in accordance with WHO. The rapid advancement of technology has led to breakthroughs in different fields such as medicine, automotive, etc. Despite advancements in screening technologies, achieving high sensitivity and specificity for early detection remains a challenge. Machine Learning is one of the front runners and is currently playing a vital role in solving real-world problems, particularly in the healthcare domain. Using different Machine Learning algorithms prediction of Breast Cancer has been tallied in this work. Various algorithms such as SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours), DT (Decision Tree), and RF (Random Forest) have vast application areas. In this study, these algorithms have been tested and evaluated on the basis of precision, recall, and accuracy which are the key performance metrics for the evaluation of the model. The dataset for breast Cancer has been pulled from Kaggle, which is the most prominently used dataset by researchers. The simulation results revealed that Random Forest outperformed the others with the precision of 94.5%, recall of 94%, and accuracy of 95%, clearly showing its potential to be used for early prediction of Breast Cancer. © 2024 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "The studies analyze the efficiency of Catharanthus alba and Catharanthus roseus cultivars as a natural antioxidant measuring antioxidant potential through two methods. In the first method, antioxidant activity was estimated through the sunflower oil model system in which the Peroxide value (PV) and Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) tests were performed. While in the second method, antioxidant activity estimation is done through the assay method in which 2, 2- Diphenyl- 1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method and ammonium thiocyanate method has been performed. The thermal stability of the leaves & flowers of Catharanthus alba and Catharanthus roseus were analyzed by mixing of powdered medicinal plant and sunflower oil. Further results indicate the higher antioxidant activity of flower Catharanthus alba as compared to flower Catharanthus roseus. Relatively among the leaves, Catharanthus roseus demonstrated slightly higher antioxidant potential than the leaves of Catharanthus alba. The antioxidant activity of Catharanthus alba (Flower)> Catharanthus roseus (Flower)> Catharanthus roseus (leaves)> Catharanthus alba (leaves) has been reported. The dehydrated powders of leaves and flowers of Catharanthus alba and Catharanthus roseus have shown good antioxidant activity at 0.5% level in sunflower oil while increase in concentration up to 1% and 1.5% does not show enhanced antioxidant activity in sunflower oil. The flowers and leaves of both cultivars of Catharanthus have shown good thermal stability when heated at 80 °C continuously for 24 h considering all the parameters with statistical significance of (p ≤ 0.001). © 2024 The Author(s).

      "Abstract": "The study unravels the relationship between trade and connectivity and presents a narrative to re-energise the South Asian regional economic integration in the post-pandemic period. In addition, the study also examines the effect on conflicts and institutional factors in South Asian trade. The study uses the bilateral gravity analysis in 2SLS (Two-Stage Least Squares) framework to address the endogeneity issues. The study finds that South Asia may gain enormously if they reduce the conflicts across the border and secure improvement in both hard and soft infrastructure. Given that the trade is a dynamic concept, connectivity disruption costs cause havoc to the region, which then promotes dis-integration. Facilitating business beyond the border in post-pandemic requires an enhanced trade facilitation and connectivity in the region. The renewed and shared agenda of the South Asian regional cooperation in post-pandemic should, therefore, aim to reduce both intra- and inter- regional trade facilitation gaps as well as to expand the connectivity. The process of South Asian regional integration has to contribute to narrowing the gaps by providing resources for the development of trade infrastructure. Therefore, South Asia has to enhance its own connectivity and trade facilitation arrangement to take forward the agenda of South Asian integration. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

      "Abstract": "Fossil fuels dominate the energy sector, but their exhausting reserves and adverse effect on the environment has encouraged search for renewable resources. Animal waste is one such renewable resource which can be used for producing biogas by the process of anaerobic digestion. Several factors like temperature, pH value, moisture content, etc. affect biogas production. This paper proposes a biogas-producing system in village Wazirpur situated in Delhi NCR. This village is having 400 buffalos, and their dung can be collected efficiently and used for producing biogas. Biomass digester is automated with manual task only limited to putting dung in the collecting tank. Automated system is controlled by Mitsubishi Electric’s FX5U programmable logic controller which mixes the dung with water, feeds to the digester, and optimizes the factors affecting biogas production. The proposed system produces 334.8 to 428 m3 biogas daily. This biogas is used as fuel for biogas genset, and the generation system is simulated in Homer in grid connected mode, giving 58,692 kWh energy annually. Net present cost and cost of energy are having negative values indicating the costs are recovered in project’s lifetime. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Aging leads to reduced cognitive abilities. A person heading toward dementia will also show such signs but with more severity. This stage is referred to as Mild Cognitive Impairment. It has been observed that nearly one-fifth of the people suffering from MCI convert to dementia. The patients suffering from MCI who convert to dementia are called MCI-Converts and those who do not convert are called MCI Non-converts. This work proposes a model that extracts gray matter from the s-MRI brain volume and explores the applicability of combination of Convolutional Neural Network and Recursive Feature Elimination in the diagnosis of MCI. Features of the data obtained using the carefully crafted CNN followed by the selection of the appropriate features using Recursive Feature Elimination are then used to accomplish the task. Empirical analysis has been done to select the parameters of the CNN. The results are better than the state of the art and pave way for the exploitation of the Deep Learning models to classify the Converts and the Non-converts. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Aim: A series of cases have been presented involving the oral cavity focusing on the presentation, diagnosis and treatment of mucormycosis that can form a basis for successful therapy. Background: The management of severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in conjunction with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hematological malignancies, organ transplants, and immunosuppression have led to a rise of mucormycosis which is an opportunistic infection. Cases Description: The various forms that have been enlisted till date are rhino-cerebral, rhino-orbital, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and disseminated mucormycosis. From the dentistry and maxillofacial surgery perspective, the cases depicting extension of mucormycosis into the oral cavity have been less frequently recorded and thus, require a detailed study. The patients that reported to our private practice had non-tender swelling, draining sinuses and mobility of teeth. A similarity was observed in the clinical signs both in osteomyelitis and mucormycosis. Thus, a histopathological examination was used to establish the definitive diagnosis. Conclusion: Mucormycosis is a life threatening pathology that requires intervention by other branches to make an early diagnosis and commence the treatment. The characteristic ulceration or necrosis is often absent in the initial stage and thus, histopathological examination and radiographic assessment are required to formulate a definitive diagnosis. Early intervention is a necessity to avoid morbidity. The treatment involves surgical debridement of the necrotic infected tissue followed by systemic antifungal therapy. Mucormycosis has recently seen a spike in its prevalence, post the second-wave of coronavirus pandemic in India. It was seen commonly in patients with compromised immunity, diabetes mellitus, hematological malignancies, or on corticosteroid therapy. Mucormycosis invading the palate mostly via maxillary sinus has been less frequently described. In the post-COVID era the features associated with mucormycosis involving oral cavity, should warrant a possible differential diagnosis and managed appropriately. © 2024, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Institute of Science and Technology of Sao Jose dos Campos.

      "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to systematically review and evaluate the relevant literature on dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS) exercises. A literature search was conducted from inception to February, 2023 within PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, Science Direct and EBSCO to identify studies related to the role of DNS in the rehabilitation of musculo-skeletal and neurological conditions. The databases were searched using the following key words: Dynamic neuromuscular stabilization, pain, physical function, stroke, hemiplegia. After the initial search full text studies related to the use of DNS exercises in the rehabilitation of musculoskel-etal or neurological conditions were selected for further review irrespective of study design. A quantitative analysis of the selected studies was done by using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tool. The systematic review identified a total of 16 studies (seven low risk, six medium risk and three high risk of bias) that met the inclusion criteria. These studies examined the effects of DNS exercises on a range of conditions, including low back pain, cerebral palsy, stroke, migraines, and posterior cortical atrophy. The findings consistently demonstrated significant improvements in core muscle activation, joint stability, functional movements, and pain reduction following DNS intervention. Additionally, improvements in specific condition-related outcomes were reported in several studies, indicating the potential effectiveness of DNS in addressing deficits related to musculoskeletal and neurological conditions. The findings of this systematic review suggest that DNS exercises have a beneficial impact on physical rehabilitation outcomes in individuals with musculoskeletal and neurological conditions. The activation of core muscles and the integrated spinal stabilization system (ISSS), facilitated through DNS, promote spinal stability, reduce pain, and enhance functional movements. This study is registered as PROSPERO No. CRD42021278224. © 2024 by Begell House, Inc.",

      "Abstract": "Alcohol use disorder is a complex biopsychosocial diagnosis that impairs not only the consumer, but also the people around him or her. The available literature majorly focusing upon the spouses of these patients, there exists a paucity in research regarding its ill effects on other populations of caregivers. Hence, the present review aims to synthesize relevant findings in regards to alcohol related disorders, highlight the gaps in existing literature, and briefly identify the treatments available. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analysis (PRISMA, 2020) guidelines, were used as a methodology for systematic review of the indian literature available in various open access platforms. A total of 100 studies were identified, and 19 of them were included for the review. The results of this systematic review are presented in various themes and sub-themes that highlight the psychosocial impact of caregiving. The paper will also discuss certain implications for further research and intervention. No risk of bias was confronted with; however, the limitations of this review are mentioned. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature India Private Limited 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Functioning as a flavoprotein, choline oxidase facilitates the transformation of choline into glycine betaine. Notably, choline oxidase and its resultant product, glycine betaine, find extensive applications across various industries and fields of study. However, its high sensitivity and tendency to lose functional activity at high temperatures reduces its industrial usage. MD simulation and mutation studies have revealed the role of certain residues responsible for the enzyme’s thermal instability. This study focuses on inducing thermal stability to choline oxidase of A. globiformis through computational approaches at a maximum temperature of 60 °C. MD simulation analysis showed that Trp 331, Val 464 and Ser 101 contribute to structural instability, leading to the instability at 60 °C. Mutation of these residues with phenylalanine residues and simulation of the mutated enzyme at 60 °C exhibited thermostability and insignificant residual fluctuation. The re-docking and MM/GBSA analyses further validated the mutated enzyme’s binding affinity and catalytic activity. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

      "Abstract": "The utilization of microbial laccase for the biological delignification of biomass is regarded as an environmentally sustainable procedure. Present study aimed to optimize the process parameters to achieve improved laccase production. Mustard oil cake was utilized as a solid substrate, and Aspergillus nidulans was employed as the fungal strain for the production of Laccase enzyme. To optimize the different physical and chemical factors for laccase production, specifically moisture content, incubation time, nutrient pH, incubation temperature, salt concentration, and additional carbon and nitrogen sources were considered. Additionally, response surface methodology was employed to optimize both the media and process parameters. The highest observed enzyme activity was 6.99 U/mL under optimum conditions. Experimental data showed that moisture content of 100% (w/v), incubation temperature of 28°C, pH range of 5-6, 6% MgSO4 (w/v) and ammonium chloride when used as supplementary salts in the production medium resulted in the maximum production of laccase. The production medium was incubated for a duration of 96 hours once optimized. To maximize laccase production, this study optimized the different media components using conventional OFAT method and further optimized the critical parameters using the response surface methodology (RSM). © Authors.",

      "Abstract": "Distributed generation involves low scale power generation at or near load centers, commonly using renewable resources. Rooftop solar photovoltaic installation provides clean energy using an already existing infrastructure. This paper proposes a solar photovoltaic installation in the Faridabad district in the state of Haryana, India. The solar plants are grid connected and are proposed for installation in eight academic institutions. These institutions are having sufficient area for large scale power generation and are geographically located throughout the district. The area available for solar panel installation is determined by surveying. The proposed solar plants are grid connected so as to overcome the intermittency in solar availability. Tata Power Solar System’s solar modules having peak power 310Wp are selected which are connected to ABB’s 500 kWac inverter. The proposed system is simulated as per the data available with METEONORM 7.2 on PVSYST 6.88 software tool which gives a total 154,849 MWh energy generated per year. The results obtained can serve as a reference for Smart Cities mission and also for generating clean energy for rural areas. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2024.",

      "Abstract": "Over the past few decades, there has been a perceptible shift in thematic focus in the field of 1947 Partition Studies. The emergent discourses adumbrate the contours of refugee migration by highlighting the oral history narratives of those who witnessed the Partition. Though the proliferation of oral narratives has led to a ‘memory boom’, there has been little discussion on temporality and memory and their relation to the act of narration. Against this backdrop, the chapter examines the oral narratives of two individuals and places them alongside the material objects that they have preserved. Since human memory etiolates with time, Aanchal Malhotra believes that memory gets transferred into these inanimate objects. Contrary to Malhotra’s observation, the chapter foregrounds that as external objects, these items in themselves do not embody meanings. However, when placed in the context of remembering the past, they reinforce the structure of the narratives and enrich the life stories. In other words, these objects add value to the stories of displacement, migration, and resettlement. Most important, these objects help in negotiating time past in time present to make the life stories timeless as the material items are handed from one generation to the other. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Rituparna Roy, Jayanta Sengupta, and Sekhar Bandyopadhyay; individual chapters, the contributors.",

      "Abstract": "Aims: To investigate the effect of dual-task training on balance and knee proprioception in both weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing conditions in older adults with significant imbalance and high risk of falling. Methods: This pre-posttest experimental design included 83 older adults (43 males, 40 females), selected based on age criteria (65–75 years) and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants underwent dual-task training consisting of 30-minute sessions, three times per week, for four weeks (totaling 12-sessions). Measures included Berg Balance Scale and knee proprioception deficit before and after dual-task training. Results: The study showed statistically significant effect of dual-task training on balance (p < 0.001) and knee proprioception in both weight-bearing (p < 0.001) and non-weight-bearing (p < 0.001) in older adults. Pre-and post-measurements of independent variables between male and female older adults showed no significant difference. Conclusions: Dual-task training improves balance and knee proprioception in both weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing conditions in older individuals, thereby enhancing stability and reducing the risk of falls. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

      "Abstract": "This study examined the need for skilled labour in Faridabad (Delhi-NCR) construction sector. The study’s goal was to assess the current situation of the skilled labour force in the construction sector, the reason behind the low frequency of skilled workers, and their impact on the completion of construction projects. The technique used for data collecting includes the spreading of structured questionnaires. Frequency tables, percentages, mean response analysis, relative importance index, and cross-tabulation were used to analyze the data. Furthermore, the most serious causes of a labour shortage turned out to be a lack of a clear career path, the great mobility of construction employees, and low pay. According to the study, construction companies do not send their skilled personnel to training programs. The study found that the lack of trained labour was causing construction companies to overpay for labour and cause schedule delays in their construction projects. Also, the study indicated that the sampled construction trades had an ageing labour base and that the entry of young workers was quite low. © 2023, Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH.

      "Abstract": "Concrete is said to be the second man – made construction material widely used in the world, and as per the studies, it will be staying at the same positions for the coming decades. With the emerging advancements in the domain of concrete technology, it’s been suggested that the same must be produced with locally available materials, including natural as well as industrial waste products. For controlling the production rate of carbon dioxide using concrete mixing process, several reinforcements are being added into the mix as a partial replacement to the main ingredients of the concrete mix, with consideration of modification in the properties of the concrete in a better manner. Nanotechnology is playing an important role in the concrete industry to make it sustainable from past few years. Nanomaterials have distinct physical and chemical properties which improve the effectiveness of materials. This study focuses on the usage of Graphene Oxide as a nanomaterial reinforcement in the concrete mix with varying proportioning ranges from zero percent to 1 percent by weight of cement. The discussions were made based on the laboratory experiments performed on the fresh and hardened concrete. Durability parameters of Graphene – induced concrete were also noted. The strength of the concrete mix with 0.08% GO has shown a better result comparatively. The values of sorptivity and permeability of the concrete mixes were observed to be reduced with increasing GO content in the concrete mix. © 2023, Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH.

      "Abstract": "Given the concrete jungle of the metropolitan cities resulting to increasing carbon footprint in the global atmosphere, the need for reduction in carbon emission is the need of the hour. Construction and its allied activities accounting for more than 38% of global carbon emission need to take part in mitigating as such. Many such metropolitan cities saw improper design and town planning resulting to water logging and drainage issues, which are a main concern. One such mitigation strategy is to implement the use of Porous Concrete on light traffic pathways. Porous concrete are construction materials that allows for seepage of water through the appropriate voids in its form without compromising its strength. Porous concrete as pavement materials will also address the drainage issues that the main Indian cities like Delhi and Mumbai are facing. It is so designed to recharge ground water as well by its seepage action. This study focused on the optimum design for strength parameters of Porous Concrete partially replaced with glass powder in 0%, 10%, 15% and 20%.

      "Abstract": "Researching Network Traffic Classification through Machine Learning is crucial given the expanding reach of the internet, enabling global information exchange. The implications of security breaches extend beyond individuals to impact entire organizations. Hence, discerning between malicious and non-malicious data on the network holds utmost significance. In this research, we perform an in-depth examination and contrast of seven distinct machine learning algorithms: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, C4.5, XGBoost, and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These analyses are executed using Python's package module for seamless programmatic execution. The assessment encompasses metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, offering valuable insights into the performance of each algorithm. © 2024, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "In the machine learning process, sometimes due to vague assumptions, an algorithm that produces results that are prejudiced systematically is called an Algorithm Bias, Artificial Intelligence Bias, or Machine Learning Bias. There are several forms of Artificial Intelligence bias that promote gender biases. Machine learning models and training data sets are influenced by human developers’ cognitive biases. An algorithm gets hardcoded by such biases and incomplete data produces gender biases as well. If any information retrieved from a dataset is omitted by a cognitive bias, it brings biases. Thus, it is very important to ensure that the Artificial Intelligence data set should represent the complete population, and built-in biases must be overcome. In the present scenario, people’s behavior and opinions are very much influenced by Artificial Intelligence knowingly and unknowingly. In the design pattern of technologies, gender inequality has crept in due to the over-representation of men in the system. The present chapter focuses on the role of Artificial Intelligence and biased algorithms in the models of the Artificial Intelligence-based decision-making process. It is essential to understand as now Artificial Intelligence and HR/higher management are going together to manage human resources to enable organizations to achieve long-term goals. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",

      "Abstract": "The need for advanced materials has always been desirable in all kinds of industries such as mechanical, aeronautical, civil and automobile. Almost all industries are looking for low-cost materials with better properties. These are the main components that attract every engineer or industrialist to produce an advanced and new material. This requirement may be attained in the form of composite materials. The better mechanical properties and light weight of composite mainly depend upon fabrication method and reinforcement used in the composite. This paper attempts to review the single and hybrid reinforcement used to prepare aluminium MMCs and liquid-phase fabrication method. Various liquid-phase fabrication methods were discussed which is used for the production of Al MMCs but especially put effort on stir casting technique. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

      "Abstract": "The Indian government reports projected the population increase of senior citizens from 13% in 2011 to 23% in 2036. In such a population expansion, it is a dire need to provide them with dignified, secure, happy, and affordable living. Further, physically, emotionally, and economically, senior citizens have a high dependency on their family members and friends. The primary data has been collected, constituting a sample size of 200 elderly people, who are above 60 years and belong to middle and high-income groups, residing in Delhi NCR. The key requirement that emerged from the study for the growing older population is the locational advantage of community living with full-fledged legal ownership of home along with affordability criteria. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",
